            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But I ſee no reaſon why the words ſhould be only reſtrained to the Jewiſh Church, nor why <hi>[illa]</hi> this, ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be underſtood of the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, whiles that which is predicated of the ſubject is common to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoule as well as to the beleeving Church: For every beleever leanes by faith upon the Lord Jeſus, and comes out of his particular wilderneſſes, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him.</p>

                  <p>In ſhort, I conceive the words have a <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> in them. The Church or ſoule ſpeaks them, as if ſhe ſhould have ſaid: Methinks I fancie the world ſtanding wondring at me, how I can leane upon Chriſt in my wilderneſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditions; and out of the ſaddeſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, how I can come up by the ſtrength of Chriſt, leaning upon him?

                     <hi>That comes up out of the wildernes.]</hi> Out of a ſad, low condition, out of a loſt, rugged condition, out of croſſes, trials, afflictions inward or outward. But I ſhall open this terme more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Leaning] Tremellius</hi> reads it, <hi>aſſocians, aſſociatura,</hi> joyning or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or about to joyne or marry her ſelfe. <hi>Vatablus, Hierome</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi>

The quarrell betwixt theſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors is not ſo great, but I conceive it may eaſily be thus taken up:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Leaning</hi> is a poſture of famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity; And ſhe that is ſo bold as to leane upon her Beloveds arme, is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lodged in her Beloveds heart; and is <hi>aſſocians,</hi> marrying, or <hi>aſſociatura,</hi> about to marry to <hi>her Beloved;</hi> and 2. <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is a poſture of love too. She that leanes, loves; and ſurely ſhe takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in her poſture, ſhe takes delight in her Beloveds company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon her Beloved]</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who loves her, and having firſt loved her, is now beloved of her. He is called <hi>Her,</hi> to denote her propriety in him. Thus you have the ſence of the former part of the Text.</p>
                  <p>The Church, or the beleeving ſoule, fancies that the world ſeeing her keep her hold on Chriſt, in ſaddeſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and keep a cloſe communion with Chriſt in the midſt of briars and thorns,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93551:14"/> in a barren heath, and dry ground, in the midſt of trials, would be ready, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ignorance, not knowing the power of grace that upheld, and helpt and ſuſtained her; or elſe admiring her happy and glorious condition, that in the wilderneſſe ſhe had ſuch a Beloved to leane upon; or admiring the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her conſtancy and patience, that ſhe would adhere to Chriſt at ſuch a low ebbe, would either by way of ſcoffing or admiring, cry out, <hi>Who is this,</hi> that nothing will part from Chriſt? Or, <hi>Who is this</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt will thus owne, and uphold in ſaddeſt conditions? Or, <hi>Who is this?</hi> What power is this that upholds this man or woman in ſuch eſtates, as every one elſe would bee loſt in? <hi>Who is this that commeth</hi> by the feet of faith and patience, up out of theſe deep ſad wildernes-ſtraights, and yet comes up with ſuch a fixed temper of ſpirit, with ſuch a ſtayed mind, and with ſuch a ſtedfaſtneſſe of reliance upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Who is this that commeth up?</hi> Thus you have the former part opened.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93551:14"/>
                  <p> It followes now in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I raiſed thee up under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, there thy mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of theſe words, and making my way cleare, theſe two things muſt be reſolved:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whoſe part of the Dialogue, whoſe ſpeech theſe words be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the meaning of them is.</p>
                  <p>The firſt great queſtion is, whoſe part in this dialogue of love theſe are? This is certaine, they are either Chriſt's or the beleevers: the opinions of men are divided about it; Some think that the words are the continued ſpeech of the Spouſe; their great reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words both before it and after it, are the Spouſes: Of this opinion are <hi>Gregory, Aquinas, Lyra, Hierom;</hi> yea and learned <hi>Mercer</hi> and M. <hi>Ainſworth.</hi> There are ſome others that think they are the words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spouſe, how he raiſed up his <hi>Church</hi> (ſay ſome) which I doe not deny, ſo they doe not limit it to the body of beleevers collectively: for my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93551:15"/> owne part I ſtrongly incline to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, viz. That the words are the words of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> my reaſons are, 1. Partly becauſe the 4 verſe containes a phraſe of ſpeech, with which ſhe had twice cloſed a ſpeech before, <hi>viz.</hi> chap. 3. 5, 6. chap. 5. 8. and partly becauſe of the <hi>congruity,</hi> which appeares to me in the ſence thus: The Spouſe before had ſeemed to caſt out words as if ſhe had bin almoſt aſhamed of <hi>Chriſts</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by her walking with him had made her ſelfe a laughing ſtock, or a wondering ſtock to the world (for ſo the phraſe, Who is this? may alſo be taken) to which Chriſt replies: I raiſed thee, &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid: and do I not deſerve this? and a great deale more too? Remember but what I have done for thee, I have raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree, &amp;c. To which (as overcome with love) the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, v. 6. <hi>Set me as a ſeale,</hi> &amp;c. As if ſhe ſhould ſay, Truth indeed; Lord thou haſt done it: <hi>O ſet me now as a ſeale upon thine arme, as a ſeale upon thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. A third reaſon is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity of the ſence, if the word be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93551:15"/> taken as the words of the Spouſe, which will further appeare in the opening of the words. The firſt queſtion being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, I come to the ſecond; <hi>To ſhew you what is the meaning of theſe words.</hi> In doing of which, 1. I ſhall ſhew you the opinion of others. 2. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject moſt of them; ſhewing you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I doe ſo. 3. I ſhall give you my owne opinion concerning the words and reaſons for it. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort. </seg>1</label> 1. I will begin with ſuch expoſitors as would have theſe words to be the Spouſes words, and theſe are either Papiſts or Proteſtants. The popiſh expoſitions run together: <hi>I</hi> (ſay they) that is, <hi>the Spouſe</hi> the beleeving ſoule: <hi>[raiſed thee]</hi> awakened and applied thee; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apple-tree,</hi> hanging upon the croſſe. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith that the apple-tree is <hi>[procul dubio arbor ſanctae crucis]</hi> the tree of the holy Croſſe. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort. </seg>2</label> M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and <hi>Mercer</hi> carry it another way. I (ſaith M. <hi>Ainſworth)</hi> that is, the Spouſe <hi>raiſed thee up,</hi> by earneſt prayer, Pſa. 44. 24. Raiſed up Chriſt <hi>under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-tree,</hi> the tree of free grace, and life mentioned, Chap. 2. 3. To this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93551:16"/> ſence <hi>Mercer</hi> inclineth. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort. </seg>3</label> A third ſort of expoſitors, are ſuch as would make this whole book a propheſy of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> they underſtand it thus: <hi>I,</hi> that is Chriſt, raiſed <hi>thee,</hi> that is, the Church of the Gentiles, <hi>under the Apple-tree,</hi> out of a low eſtate (ſay ſome) by the help of <hi>ſome inferiour Magiſtrate,</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Cotton.</hi> But I want an inſtance of the Metaphor ſo uſed, to patronize that opinion. I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you now the ſeverall opinions, which I ſhall reject for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
                  <p>For the Popiſh opinion, If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſence of the words to be this, That the Spouſe <hi>raiſed</hi> Chriſt upon the Croſſe, what ſhall become of the next words, <hi>there thy mother brought thee forth?</hi> Did Chriſts mother bring him forth there? if ſo: either his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall</hi> mother, or his <hi>myſticall</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall</hi> mother; for his <hi>perſonall</hi> mother, in reſpect of his divine Nature, he had none; for his humane Nature, <hi>Mary</hi> was his mother: But how can we ſay concerning the Croſſe, <hi>There</hi> Chriſts <hi>mother brought him forth?</hi> If it

                  <p> For the third ſort I reject their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 1. Becauſe I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould turne this whole book into a Prophecye. 2. And for M. <hi>Cottons</hi> ſingle opinion I gave my reaſon againſt it before.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now propound my owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and rather ſeeke for company than follow any. 1. I lay it downe for a ground, that the words are the words of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beleeving ſoule. 2. I take it for granted, that the deſigne of Chriſts ſpeech to the beleeving ſoule his Spouſe, is to mind her of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table engaging mercy he had beſtowed upon her; a deliverance, 1. Out of ſome low eſtate; that methinks is plaine, both from the word uſed <hi>[raiſed]</hi> which preſuppoſeth a fallen eſtate. 2. Out of ſome eſtate in which it was <hi>naturally;</hi> that me thinks is plainly hinted in thoſe words; <hi>There thy mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to give you the ſence of the words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[I]</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <note place="margin">The words opened.</note>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93551:17"/> thy Redeemer [raiſed thee up] exalted thee by the great worke of my redemption [under the Apple-tree] The Apple-tree is Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Under my ſelfe by the uſe of mine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which are the fruit of the Apple-tree, Chriſt: or [I raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree] when thou wert not <hi>ingrafted</hi> in me, but in a ſtate of diſunion, indeed [under the Apple-tree] in reſpect of <hi>eternall ordination,</hi> but not in the Apple-tree by an <hi>actuall implantation</hi> and union: When thou wert in that ſad eſtate <hi>I raiſed</hi> thee up, by the great worke of my redemption. It followes, there thy mother brought thee forth, &amp;c. there! where? in a loſt condition, in a ſtate of diſunion, a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me. There, under the Tree of forbidden fruit, involved in <hi>Adams</hi> firſt guilt, weltring in bloud, &amp;c. <hi>There ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the ſence of the words is this:</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou think much to leane upon me in the wilderneſſe O my Spouſe! remember thou wert in a poor loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Condition, in ſuch an eſtate thy naturall mother brought thee forth; it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93551:18"/> true thou wert under an eternall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to obtaine Salvation by me, but thou wert far from ſuch an vnion: there thy mother left thee, and could not help thee, and then <hi>I raiſed thee.</hi> I by the great worke of my redemption, covenanting, coming, dying, &amp;c. for thee, raiſed thee from this miſery to eternall life, and all the privileges of it, and this I did when all other meanes failed, <hi>[There thy mother brought thee forth]</hi> by the uſe of my ordinances thou wert raiſed under the apple-tree: ſo that the deſigne of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the ſpeech, Is to ſhew the beleeving ſoule what cauſe ſhe had in all eſtates to cleave to him, more than all the world beſides; and this he demonſtrates, 1. By <hi>letting her ſee her miſerable eſtate by nature.</hi> 1. She had need of raiſing. 2. She was in a ſtate of diſunion, not united to the apple-tree. 2. By <hi>letting of her ſee the hopeleſneſſe of any remedy from any thing in the world,</hi> any friend in the world; ſurely the mother is the beſt friend, and yet (ſayes he) this eſtate ſhe left you in, yea ſhe that bare you. 3.

By <hi>letting of her know the meanes were his</hi> (for ſo alſo the words [under the apple-tree] may be underſtood) <hi>I raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee.</hi> The ſoule may ſay, why? the word raiſed me? yes, it is true, but ſtill thou art raiſed under Chriſt: For Chriſt is the apple-tree, The ordinances are the apples, and they alſo grow out of Chriſt, even as naturally, as the Apples growe out of the apple-tree.</p>
                  <p>The text being thus opened, holds out to us many pretious truths. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it is the deſcription of a Saint, <hi>à primo ad ultimum,</hi> from firſt to laſt. In particular you have here the Spouſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, 1. <hi>In her naturall Condition,</hi> where you are told, 1. What ſhe is <hi>originally,</hi> ſo ſhe is in a ſtate of diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, in ſuch a condition that ſhe hath need of raiſing, ſo her mother
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93551:19"/> brought her forth, ſo ſhe brought her forth that bare her. 2. What ſhe is then <hi>virtually,</hi> though not implanted into Chriſt, yet within a reach of him; <hi>under</hi> the applee-tree, though not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>in</hi> it; under an eternail ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to life, though for the preſent a <hi>Child of wrath;</hi> in a wilderneſſe, yet comming out, or to come out.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93551:20"/>
                  <p> I ſhall begin with the firſt Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That the beſt of Gods Saints by nature were born in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in a ſtate of diſunion to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, there their mother brought them forth, there ſhe brought them forth that bare them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay the beſt, though they all of them lye under a ſaving ordination to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and though many of them may be borne of holy and godly parents, yet if you looke upon them as they are by Nature, they are in a loſt, undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and had need of a raiſing. Now for the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall 1. prove it by <hi>teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 2. I ſhall open it to you how it comes to paſſe that they are ſo borne. 3.

M. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſayes it may be done two wayes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Adam being a publique perſon carrying all us in his loynes, and God ordering that what he received he ſhould receive for himſelfe, and all his poſterity, hereupon Adam Sinning deprived himſelfe, and all his peſterity,</hi> So we became miſerable, God dealing like a judge, depriving us, for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, of his Image, which except he would he need never have ſtampt upon us, (not any wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming by this act of judgement an author or maintainer of ſinne) thus

Lord, how few are they whom thou haſt choſen ever to obtaine eternall life? and yet theſe are <hi>children of wrath</hi> by nature as well as others. Poore creatures! my heart trembles to thinke of you: How many in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation yet lye in a condition low enough, and the Lord knowes whether ever to be raiſed yea or no. If a child ſhould be borne with ſome naturall weakneſſe in its armes, or leggs, and it ſhould live ſix, or ten, or twenty years, and yet not be able to uſe its limbs, you would ſay it would be a very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard if ever that child did recover its limbs, ſo as to have the ſtrength and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, it would be almoſt a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; It was ſuch a miracle, that in the ninth of John, when Jeſus Chriſt had reſtored ſight to one that was borne blind, the Jewes would not beleeve it poſſible, and <hi>ver.</hi> 32. we find a poſitive
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93551:26"/> determination upon the queſtion, <hi>Since the world began, it was never heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blind:</hi> How many poore wretches that are come here into the preſence of the Lord, that were all borne blind, deafe, dead, and have lived ſome ten, ſome twenty, ſome thirty yeares, ſome more, and all this time have continually had all the meanes that could be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them for recovery, and yet are in the ſame loſt, undone condition? Ah (my friends!) what can you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtretch out hand, nor foot, nor tongue, nor any member, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the meanes of grace aſtoorded you for quickning? Let me tell you, it is ten thouſand to one, if you doe not periſh for ever: My friends! It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, a great miracle of mercy, that any one poore wretch, conſidering in what condition it is borne, ſhould ever come out of it. The Jewes would hardly beleeve the report, therefore they ſay, Joh. 9. 19. <hi>Is this your ſonne that was borne blind, how then doth he now ſee?</hi> We may ſay ſo concerning every one that hath any thing of God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93551:27"/> in him: Was not this poore creature borne blind? how doth he now ſee? was not he borne loſt? How is he now raiſed? but for thoſe that in ſtead of growing better, are growne ten times worſe, that have hardened their hearts, and gone on in riot, and wantonneſſe, and are yet in their bloud, it is ten to one if ever the Lord ſay to them, <hi>live;</hi> they are growne to ſuch a ſhameleſſe impudence in wickedneſſe, I dare not ſay, <hi>there is no hope;</hi> But let me ſadly ſay, there is ſmall hope that ever the Lord ſhould raiſe ſuch wretches: And if he doth not, better ten thouſand times, better (ſinner,) had it been for thy ſoule, that thou hadſt never ſeen the light of the morning, nor heard the voice of the Goſpell in thine eares. This is your condition, the Lord awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, From hence we may be inſtructed, <hi>Whom we have cauſe to thanke that any of us are this day out of hell.</hi> Who art thou O man that boaſts thou art of good parentage, or of a great birth? harke in what language my Text ſpeaks thy birth: Thou wert borne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93551:27"/> under the <hi>Apple-tree; there thy mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi> If thy heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth no more for thee than thy earthly mother, woe to thee that ever thou wert borne. What a boaſting we have of pedegrees, and great deſcents? What a great word it is in the world, I was better borne than you, My father was ſuch a Gentleman, ſo great, ſo rich, &amp;c. My mother was of ſuch or ſuch an ancient Family? O vanity! vanity of vanities! Poore creature! thy mother brought thee forth under an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree. The very heathen out of a meere rationall principle, could ſcoffe at ſuch brags:<hi>—Genus &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipſi Vix ea noſtra voco. Tully</hi> could retort to the Roman, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his deſcent, <hi>Domus mea à me incipiet, tua verò in te deſinet,</hi> My houſe ſhall have its Originall from me, my Nobility and worth; thy Noble Family ſhall have an end in thy Baſeneſſe. Chriſtian! what is thy birth? conſider it but in a ſpirituall notion; the pooreſt wretch in the world is borne in as good a condition as thou art, and thou
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93551:28"/> in no better an eſtate towards God than he. Suppoſe a man were borne of ſome great parentage, and had no Lands, no eſtate left him, but could only boaſt of <hi>fumos, &amp; nomina vana Catonum,</hi> his fathers name, and the ſmoake of his chimney; Poſſibly he hath ſome gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous ſuit of apparell left him, this he weares and gliſters in for a while, yet a little while and theſe teare, and then he hath not a rag left him, nor a penny to buy one to cover his nakedneſſe: how contemptible would ſuch a poore wretch be in every mans eyes? And is not this the condition of the moſt of the great men, gallants of the world, they gliſter with an outſide a little in the world, their names are great, their perſons admired; yet a little while, and theſe weare out, the men dye, and lye downe in hell. Ah! that thoſe that glory would glory in this, that God is their Father, and Jeſus Chriſt their portion: Thus your Houſes would have a beginning of Glory from you, and their Glory ſhould not end with you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is the boaſting of thoſe much better that can boaſt of their Religious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93551:28"/> Parents. I confeſſe it is the better of the two, an heire of Glory being farre more noble than the greateſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in regard that the Election of God runs much in a line; but this will not doe Chriſtian: <hi>Eſau</hi> was rejected though he was <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſonne; and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> though he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonne. <hi>Juſtus non gignit juſtum, gignit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi> Thy righteous father did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee a righteous man, but he begat thee a child of fleſh, corrupt fleſh and bloud. Thy godly mother brought thee forth under the Apple-tree, <hi>there thy mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi> This was the Jewes great brag, <hi>that they came forth out of the waters of</hi> Judah, <hi>and were called by the name of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and were of the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 1. They call'd themſelves of the Holy City, and this made them ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the God of Iſrael; but for all this obſerve what God ſayes to them, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. This was that which the Jewes had to boaſt of to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Joh. 8. 33. <hi>We are</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>ſeed, and were never in bondage to</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93551:29"/> 
                     <hi>any man, how ſayeſt thou, you ſhall be made free?</hi> They tooke it ill, that they being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſhould be ſo much as ſuppoſed to be in a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But obſerve how Chriſt takes away their brag in the 39. <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaith unto them, <hi>if you were</hi> Abrahams <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> [that is, his ſpirituall children] <hi>you would doe the works of</hi> Abraham: But in plainer Engliſh, ver. 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devill, and the luſts of your Father you will doe.</hi> Heare this you that had godly parents, and your ſelves have no goodneſſe in you. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith will carry none to heaven but himſelfe: your parents faith will want a way of conveyance to doe good to your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Graft a ſweet Peare or Plumme up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wild or ſowre Crab-ſtocke, it will grow, and yeeld a pleaſant fruit, the nature will be changed in the fruit; but now take the ſtone or kernell of that fruit, and ſet it in the earth, it ſhall not come forth a Plum-tree, but a Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock againe. It is thy caſe (Chriſtian,) thy parent was a naturall Crabſtocke, the Lord grafted grace upon him, then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93551:29"/> he brought forth ſweet and pleaſant fruit, worthy of amendment of life: But now thou art his kernell come out of the earth; thou art not come forth gracious, but naturall. Thy parents grace was by vertue of an inoculation, not by nature. Therefore to conclude this uſe, let me mind you of the words of the firſt Goſpell-preacher, <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. ver. 8. <hi>Bring forth fruit therefore worthy of amendment of life, and thinke not to ſay within your ſelves we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> Looke to your condition Chriſtians: It is neither your noble, nor yet gracious parentage, and deſcent, will carry you to heaven; think not to ſay within thy ſelf, I had a gracious parent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, from hence we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, what a ſoul-cheating principle Libertines build on, that conclude thus, <hi>There is no need of Repentance, or faith, or ſuch holy and ſtrict life: if we be elected, we ſhall be ſaved, if not, we ſhall be damned.</hi> Suppoſe thou beeſt elected, poore creature yet know thou art borne under the Apple-tree. O turne not the grace of thy God into wantonneſſe;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93551:30"/> looke to find thy ſelfe raiſed, or thou ſhalt never ſee thy ſoule ſaved. It is true, for the ſinnes of thoſe whom the Lord hath choſen by name to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, they are decretally pardoned from all eternity, and meritoriouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in the death of Chriſt; but ſtill they remaine as offences to God, and keep the ſoule under a reall obligation unto death, till the Lord comes, and actually and formally in juſtification acquits the beleeving ſoule from hels claime, and frees it out of the Devils impriſonment. Suppoſe a condemned man in priſon, the Prince hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to pardon him, and ſome friend of his poſſibly hath purchaſed his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for him; but yet he is in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in fetters, in the Gaolers hand, till he be actually ſet free, &amp;c. So it is with every Elect Veſſell. Cheat not thy ſelfe therefore with ſuch licentious, ſoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving principles of Libertiniſme.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93551:31"/> by the meaneſt capacities, we muſt underſtand that there are two ſorts of Natures, A more corrupt, or a more refined ſort of Nature. All ſhort of Grace is Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If thou haſt nothing ſeen in thee but corrupt filthy nature,</hi> That thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination carries thee out to acts of prophane wickedneſſe, and thou haſt not ſo much as put a bridle upon thy wild ſpirit, but letſt it run at randome, and carry thee out to drunkenneſſe, wantonneſſe, lying, ſwearing, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ungodlineſſe, This thou mayeſt be ſure of, thou art not raiſed yet out of thy helliſh danger in which thou wert borne, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>

Is Chriſt in his Ordinances precious to thy ſoule, that thou deſireſt the ſincere milke of the word, as the new borne babe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the milke of the breaſts? Doth the very thinking of Chriſt raviſh thy heart? Doth the naming of him carry thy ſoule almoſt above it ſelfe in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of love? Is he like an Apple to thy taſt, that thy mouth is filled with the ſweetneſſe of his juice? High thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt argue that Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritually taſted by thy ſoule. Art thou melted with his love? It is a ſigne thou haſt taſted of the fruit of the Apple-tree.</p>

Try thy ſelf by this Chriſtian: Is Chriſt cordiall to thy ſoul? when thy ſoul is fainting, ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the thoughts of thy ſelf, and thine owne wickedneſſe and vileneſſe, Doth it then comfort thee to remember Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his love and merits? Chriſt is no cordiall to wicked, unbeleeving wretches, it terrifieth them the more to remember Jeſus Chriſt. When the Lord hath awakened their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtartled them in their naturall condition, tell them of Chriſt, this adds fuell to the flame. Why? It is this Chriſt, whom they have ſcorned, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, crucified.

Try thy ſelfe by this, Chriſtian, whether Chriſt be in thee yea or no: If he be, thou deriveſt ſtrength from him, and he maintaineth ſpiritual life in thee. Obſerve that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. v. 14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi> Doſt thou find that thy heart is growing? that by a ſtrength derived from Jeſus Chriſt, thou walkeſt and goeſt on from ſtrength to ſtrength?

God ſayes, <hi>that thoſe that are of cleane hands ſhall grow ſtronger, and ſtronger;</hi> And that the Righteous ſhall grow up like the calves in the ſtall, which grow apace, and fat. Nay thou wilt find not only a growth, but that thou groweſt from that Nouriſhment that Chriſt Jeſus affords thy ſoule, that thou walkeſt in his ſtrength, and that all the ſtrength of thy ſoule is purely derived from him, not from thy owne indeavours, and walkings: Try therefore thy heart Chriſtian, if thou haſt eaten of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, thou wilt find them Nutritive, it will not be like the ſwallowing of a dry ſtone or ſtick, that have no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing quality in them.</p>

There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Jeſus Chriſt, in thy eyes, face, tongue, hands: and abundance of him in thy heart. Thy head is full of thoughts of Chriſt, and plottings, and deſignes for Chriſt. The wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy eye is reſtrained by the law of Chriſt; the vanity of thy tongue is taken away, and the Lord hath made thee one of a pure lanquage; thy hand is awed by Chriſt, that it dare not ſtretch forth it ſelfe to doe any iniquity; thy feet are guided by Chriſt, His word is a light unto thy feet, and a lanthorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy paths. And now for thy ſoule and inward man, thy Underſtanding is full of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Yea thou haſt determined with thy ſelfe to know nothing but Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> Thou ſeeſt abundance of Chriſt in the rich diſpenſations of free and infinite grace.

Nay more, you muſt not onely have an hand, but ſuch an hand as will reach, to this end, 1 A true hand. 2 A perfect hand. 3 A
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93551:38"/> lively hand.—1 <hi>It muſt be a true hand.</hi> A painted hand reacheth nothing; the hand muſt be a reall hand that plucketh the Apple-tree. There is a great deale of droſſy counterfeit faith in the world. The Devils have ſome graines of faith amongſt them, the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>They beloeve and tremble.</hi> Wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretches have their degrees of faith too; they will at leaſt tell you they beleeve that Chriſt came into the world, and dyed, they give credence to the ſtory, &amp;c. But this faith is no true hand, it will plucke never an apple of Life.—2. <hi>As the hand muſt be true, ſo it muſt be perfect,</hi> it muſt have fingers enough to doe it: It muſt be perfect juſtifying faith, though it reach not the perfection of faith that a juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may have. There are ſeverall acts of faith: ſome will have knowledge to be an act of it; others, and the moſt ſay, that knowledge is ſuppoſed to faith, but Aſſent is the firſt and loweſt act. Many goe hither, and no further, they goe away not juſtified: but the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that faith which juſtifies, lyeth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93551:38"/> in a truſting too, and a relyance upon, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. To this faith are all the promiſes pronounced, <hi>Bleſſed is that man that puts his truſt in the Lord;</hi> And who is he that ſits in darkneſſe, and ſeeth no light? <hi>Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> I ſay, this is the perfection of that faith which muſt be <hi>[de neceſſitate,]</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required to juſtification: It is not the reflection of faith that is in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon. Try thy ſelfe, O Chriſtian, doſt thou truly beleeve then, not barely aſſenting, and giving credence to the word of God as a word of truth, but being ſenſible of thy owne vileneſſe, and the inſufficiency that is in thy ſelfe for any ſalvation? doſt thou truly relye upon Jeſus Chriſt? and this will be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the third particular, neceſſary to the hand that reacheth.—3 <hi>The hand that reacheth muſt be lively:</hi> It muſt have a principle of life in it ſelfe, and muſt act in lively operations. The dead hand, let it be never ſo true fleſh and bloud, it reacheth nothing, it hath no internall principle of life in it ſelfe to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93551:39"/> carry it out in externall operations of Life: ſo muſt it be with the ſouls hands, that reach, and plucke the Apples of free grace of the Tree of Life, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. It muſt have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principle of Life. The hypocrites faith hath no internall principle of life in it, the ſoule is not quickned, neither hath it any power to act externall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: <hi>Viva fides eſt operoſa,</hi> is a knowne maxime, Faith in the Saints is powerfull, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>The worke of faith with power,</hi> Jam. 2. 17. Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works is dead. Now it's lively, 1. Internally, purging the heart, <hi>It puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart.</hi> 2. Externally, it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love; it worketh as a loving heart towards God; ſo in acts of love. Faith, if it be true, hath not only a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading and comforting quality, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſoule of God, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of him that hath promiſed, and to refreſh the ſoule by ſtaying upon God, but it hath a quickning quality, to enliven the ſoule, and quicken it to an holy cloſe walking with God. The ſame faith that ſaith to the ſoule, this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93551:39"/> promiſe is the truth of God, ſtay thy ſelfe upon it, ſaith alſo to the ſoule, this precept is the rule of God, walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it. Now Chriſtian, try thy ſelfe whether thou haſt taſted of the fruit of the Apple-tree, whether thou haſt a portion in Jeſus Chriſt, yea or no: If thou haſt reached to thy ſoule an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of free grace, thou haſt an hand by which thou didſt it; it muſt be a true hand: Faith is the hand. Haſt thou not the painted faith of the hypocrite, but the true faith of the Saints, called by a diſtinguiſhing character, <hi>The faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Titus 1. v. 1. Haſt thou not a finger only, but the perfect hand, that faith which truly juſtifieth thy ſoule, which doth not conſiſt in a bare notion and knowledge, nor yet in a bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but in a fiduciall cleaving to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Is it <hi>lively?</hi> as <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> in reſpect of the inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo <hi>lively,</hi> in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operations? If ſo, then it may be a true faith, and thy hand with which thou haſt reacht the fruit of the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree for the comfort of thy ſoule, may be ſuch a one as will doe it, and thy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93551:40"/> hope may be upon good and juſtifiable grounds; but if not, deceive not thy owne ſoule, Chriſt and you are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers yet, and thou art out of Chriſt. I ſhall adde but one Note more, which ſhall be yet further for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this. Laſtly therefore know, <hi>Thou canſt have no ſuch hand, unleſſe it be given thee from above.</hi> The hand of Faith is none of Natures products. Alas, how many cheat themſelves with Faith, when the Devill hath (indeed) as much true faith as they have? There is a naturall perſwaſion, and there is a morall perſwaſion, and there is a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall perſwaſion, and a diabolicall perſwaſion, all theſe differ from the worke of Faith, which is true, and that hand which muſt reach Jeſus Chriſt to my ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is <hi>a naturall perſwaſion.</hi> Nature hath principles to perſwade the ſoule by to ſome Aſſent: Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us, there is a God, and he muſt be worſhipped. Looke upon me ſaith Nature, <hi>Praeſentemque refert quaelibet herba Deum,</hi> I have not a ſpire of graſſe, but tels thee there is a God. See the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93551:40"/> variety, greatneſſe, beauty of my work; Read a great God, in a great Whale or Elephant; a beauteous God, in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flower; A wiſe God, in my choice of works. Behold a God, in the order thou haſt ſeen in me. See him in my Law written in thy heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. From theſe and ſuch like things, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bequeathes a faith to the ſoule, and learnes it, <hi>credere Deum,</hi> to beleeve a God: But this is far from faith, not only from juſtifying faith, but alſo from faith, as to that point. It wants that ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of aſſent which muſt be in aſſent when an act of faith. A <hi>Roman</hi> writ to <hi>Tully,</hi> to write him ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immortality of the ſoule. <hi>Tully</hi> writ back againe to him, <hi>Evolve libr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m Platonis &amp; nihil amplius eſt quod deſideres.</hi> Read (ſaith he) <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi> Book over concerning it, and you will deſire no more. The <hi>Roman</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes him anſwer, <hi>Evolvi, iterum at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que iterum evolvi, &amp;c.</hi> I have read it over, ſaith he, againe and againe, but I know not whence it is, when I reade it, I aſſent to it, but I have no ſooner laid the book out of my hand, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93551:41"/> to doubt againe, whether the ſoule be immortall yea or no. So it is with all perſwaſion from natural principles; as to that extent of Doctrine it would perſwade us of, the perſwaſion that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from them is faint, and weake; one while we thinke it is true, another while we queſtion, or deny the ſame principle. Naturall perſwaſion is no faith; if Nature gave thee all thou haſt, thou haſt none at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If it bee Moralities gift to thee, it is no faith.</hi> I call that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſwaſion, which is wrought from the conſideration, and improvement of Morall Principles: if thou beeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to reſt, and rely upon God and his promiſes for ſalvation, meerely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this skore, I live juſtly, I tythe Mint and Annis, I have taken no mans Oxe or Aſſe from him, whom have I defrauded? Alas, thus <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> might beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thy Faith be thy grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Legacy to thee, it is no hand that will reach the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> A tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall perſwaſion is no faith. If thou beeſt perſwaded that Chriſt dyed for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93551:41"/> thee, &amp;c. upon this skore, My Mother told me ſo, our fore-fathers held ſo, and they were wiſer than wee, &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las friend, there is as much difference betwixt faith, and thy ſoule, as there is betwixt heaven and hell. This was the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> Religion, which the good woman was as tenacious of, as ours are now of the Common Prayer Book, Joh. 4. 20. <hi>Our Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in this mountaine, and you ſay in Jeruſalem is the place to worſhip.</hi> It is the great objection wee have againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That they would have men beleeve <hi>as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves:</hi> But for the moſt part wee are condemned in what we condemne. Doe not moſt men beleeve as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beleeved? What a ſinne it is thought to thinke of ſtripping Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reformation? Are not moſt men limitted to this faith? and is not here all the perſwaſion that men have of the ſaving Truths of God, that Chriſt was God and man, that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, roſe, and is aſcended? Why? this was our Fathers Faith, this wee were taught when wee were little ones.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93551:42"/> and upon this skore (being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) they muſt goe under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beleevers; and when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell meet, this Faith ſhall ſave them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thy faith be the Devills gift to thee, it is no hand that will reach Chriſt.</hi> The Devill hath his Apes-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced-Graces; Morall walking inſtead of Goſpell-obedience; Feare of Hell in ſtead of feare of God; and ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſtead of Faith. He carries too great deſignes. 1. To flatter the ſoule to hell, by preſumption. Thinke nothing ill of thy ſelfe ſayes the Devill, venture upon God, let it never trouble thee, venture all, yes doe, and cry confidently, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to me, I have prayed in thy name, &amp;c.</hi> Hee knowes well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the anſwer will be, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, you workers of iniquity.</hi> Feare not, ſaith the Devill, to apply hot boiling Luſts to the bleeding wounds of Chriſt, you may reſt upon him that dyed for you, though you doe not take any ſuch care to live ſtrictly and holily with him: other folk ſhall goe to heaven beſides Puritanes; God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93551:42"/> is mercifull. Is thy faith ſuch a one as this Chriſtian? O tremble at that <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. And would not one thinke that this were the miſerable faith of moſt of men. It is impoſſible, but when you heare ſo many peales in your eares of repentance, as you heare in theſe dayes, but you ſhould have ſome thoughts what ſhall become of your poor ſoules: And who ſo lookes upon your lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſeeth no repentance, no ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe and ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> no care of future obedience, but a looſe irreligious walking; would he not bee confident that the Devill hath perſwaded you to venture? it is but a ſoule loſt, (but poor wretch it is loſt for ever) and Chriſt is mercifull (but to no ſuch hell-hounds as thou art wretch) O Lord! it would make an heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to ſome poore Creatures upon their Death-bed, and examine the condition of their ſoules: Why? they are well, they reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, they are confident he will ſave them, (who is bolder than blinde Bayard, is our Countrey Proverb?) though all know, the wretch never was ſenſible

                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi> It is grounded upon divine perſwaſion, The Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt: theſe are the grounds that perſwade the ſoule to rely upon Jeſus Chriſt, Rom. 14. 14. <hi>I know my ſelfe, and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The worldling is perſwaded after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion, from naturall or morall Principles, or Tradition; or at beſt, as concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 21.

Now try thy ſelfe Chriſtian, whether thy hand be a true hand: Is thy faith a gift of God wrought by his Spirit, and grounded upon his Word? ſuch muſt that hand be that plucketh the fruit of this Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of free grace; Not mans, much leſſe the devills gift, but Gods gift: it will quicken thee in Gods wayes, but I ſpake of that before. I have now done with my rules of examination; the Lord perfect this Application in every one of your ſoules.</p>

Ah, Chriſtian, wouldſt thou be but perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the morning of thy Converſion, when the Lord hath brought thy ſoule to himſelfe, wouldſt thou bee but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to look with a ſerious eye of meditation, what dangers thou haſt eſcaped, now many times in the mad age of thy youth thou ranſt over ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, and wert juſt ſinking; wouldſt thou but remember how often thou dividedſt an haire betwixt thy ſoule and hell, and this not once, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93551:45"/> againe, and againe; that the Devill had not thy ſoule onely in chaſe, but was bearing at thee many a time, and hell was opening its jawes upon thee, and thy ſoule was juſt going alive into the pit. Ah, Chriſtian, wouldſt thou but thinke of this, me thinks thou ſhouldſt even be ready to ſink downe, and dye in aſtoniſhment: nay rather live, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, aſcend, let thy heart aſcend in praiſes; O ſay, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule;</hi> My heart, and all <hi>that is within me, praiſe his holy Name;</hi> My tongue, and all that is without me, ſing unto his glory. Ah! what a miracle of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is that ever one poor ſoule ſhould come to heaven? Stand amazed at it, O my ſoule! were not wee all borne blinde? How doe any of us ſee? O now let us all ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſalme 116. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>O Lord! truely we are thy ſervants, we are thy ſervants, and the children of thine hand-maidens, for thou haſt looſed our bonds.</hi> I ſhall ſhut up this firſt Branch of the Exhortation, with the words of the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you (brethren) by the mercies of</hi>

                     <hi>God, that you offer up your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice: And bee not conformed to this world, but be yee transformed by the renewing of your mindes, that yee may prove what is that good, that acceptable, and perfect will of God.</hi> Ah, Chriſtians, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves your hearts and hands.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, were you, even you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, alſo out of Chriſt when your Mother brought you forth? Ah, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes then, the ſenſe of your owne miſery ſhould call for the yernings of your ſoules to thoſe poore creatures that are yet in it. I beſeech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren, <hi>to put on (as the elect of God holy and beloved) bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> It was the Apoſtles exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. Ah, how many objects of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93551:46"/> ſuch Charity is there every where? How many poore wretches in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Congregation, in every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Lord knoweth are yet in the ſtate of Nature? It is ten to one but all of us have either an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a Wife, a Father, or a Mother, or a childe, or a brother, or a ſiſter, or a friend ſo. As the Elect of God put on bowels of mercy for them, pitty them, pray for them, mourne before God for them; pluck them, as brands out of the fire: you know what their condition is, how ſad and deplorable, and what an object of pitty they are. Wee that never were yet in the Spaniſh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nor ever were yet in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Captivity, yet from but the meer reports of the ſlavery that poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuffer there, our ſoules yerne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſufferings, and wee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times could weep to thinke of them, and could bee content to part with ſome pence to contribute towards their reliefe. So for our poore breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though (praiſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be our God) wee have not ſeene ſuch butcherings, and rapes, as they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93551:46"/> have done, nor felt ſuch penury and pinching want as they have done, yet he ſcarce deſerves the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian amongſt us that hath not a yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoule towards them, that doth not pray for them, that is not afflicted to heare thoſe ſad and dolefull relations concerning their ſufferings, and that would not to his ability contribute ſomething to relieve them. Ah, (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,) that you would be but as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſoule-evills, as bodily trifling calamities. Is not, think you, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of hell as ſad and dreadfull as to be a Turkiſh Gally-ſlave? Is not it as ſad to be under the Devills clutches as it can be to be in the fingers, and under the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells. Alas! let them doe what they can, they ſhall doe no more but <hi>kill the body,</hi> there is their malice ſpit, if that bee done; but here both body and ſoule are in danger for ever. And my friends, do you think that the <hi>Turke</hi> hath the tenth part of the Captives that the Devill hath? Do you thinke there is not ten thouſand times more poore ſoules under the Devills Laſhes, than there is Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93551:47"/> under the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells? and have they a ſword, have they torments like him? and where is the ſoule mournes over the Drunkard, vaine perſon, the ſwearer, or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? where is the ſoule that ſayes to him, what are you about to doe? and yet I dare ſay, here is not one in this Congregation, that hath not a Father, or a Mother, a childe, a brother, or a ſiſter, or a friend, in that Captivity. O Chriſtians, conſider, did not you need pitty and prayers, thinke you, when you were there? <hi>O, ſave others with feare, pulling them out of the fire:</hi> O pray, pray. It may bee it is but yet a day, and this <hi>Herod,</hi> the Devill, intends to make an end of theſe poore ſoules: Cry, cry mightily to God for your poor Children, Friends, Acquaintance. Hark how the Church of the Jewes prayed for the Church of the Gentiles when they were ſtrangers to God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>We have a little ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts: what ſhall wee doe for our ſiſter in the day when ſhee ſhall bee ſpoken for?</hi> So ſay, O Lord, I have a little Childe, a Father, a Mother, an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93551:47"/> Husband, a Brother, a Siſter, a Friend, that hath no grace; Lord what ſhall I doe for her in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for. Remember your owne miſery, and you will pitty their poor ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, Were you all borne out of Chriſt? in a ſad undone condition by Nature? Then let mee perſwade you to keep humble hearts: Remember but what you were. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tame the ſwellings of your ſpirits, to thinke that you were not borne worth a ragge to cover your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, you were caſt out into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field, to the loathing of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It was that which the Apoſtle ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to bring downe the ſwellings of pride in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>For who maketh thee to differ from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Let mee apply thoſe very words to thy ſoule Chriſtian. Art thou proud of thy gifts, and proud of thy graces, that thou dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt from another, and excelleſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93551:48"/> others are nothing to thee, &amp;c. I beſeech thee to conſider, <hi>who maketh thee to differ?</hi> How came there to be ſuch a difference betwixt thee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians? I am ſure you were once both under the Apple-tree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there your mothers brought you forth, there ſhe brought you forth that bare you. Hath Chriſt made thee to differ? <hi>What haſt thou then that thou diddeſt not receive? Now if thou diddeſt receive it, why diddeſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Wilt thou boaſt? boaſt of thy owne then Chriſtian; boaſt of thy workes, not of thy gifts: give Chriſt his owne, and thou art not worth a farthing, yea the Lord knowes ten thouſand times worſe than a begger. Wee ſay, (and truely too) that one that hath been very ſcandalous, if ever the Lord brings him in, he had need bee very circumſpect and humble. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one that hath been of a verie low and meane condition, and by the meere favour of the Prince is raiſed up to ſome great dignity, wee ſay it will be a great deale of policy in him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93551:48"/> to carry himſelfe humbly in his place. Truely, Chriſtian, I know no actuall difference, by Nature, betwixt thee, and the vildeſt damned Reprobate in Hell. Indeed there was a difference in God the Fathers Book of Election, and in Chriſts Book of Redemption, (which is but a tranſcript of the other) but a Creature difference there was none, no ſelfe-difference at all. Hath the Lord brought thee in? thou hadſt need walke humbly, and circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Philip</hi> would have the Boy to cry at his Chamber doore, <hi>Philippe memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mortalis es; Philip</hi> thou art a mortall man, remember it: be not proud of thy Empire, thy Diadem muſt lye downe in the duſt. I would have the Chriſtian that the Lord hath given great gifts, and parts, to be minded of his firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: I would have my Text written in his heart, repeated in his eares. O remember, Chriſtian, who it was that <hi>Raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree, there thy mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi> And now I have done with my Uſe of Exhortation in its ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93551:49"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> I have but one word more, and that is Conſolation. Is it ſo, that we are borne under the Apple-tree, though under [out of Chriſt] yet under, not out of ſight or hope. The Apple-tree is over us, though by Nature we have no hand to reach up to it. Here's then a word of comfort and hope.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To thoſe that upon ſerious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the Lord hath made ſeriouſly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that to this houre they are out of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if yet they be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to get into him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To thoſe of Gods people that walke with ſad hearts, for the ſpirituall eſtate of their children, husbands, wives, friends, &amp;c. conſidering that they were all borne out of Chriſt, and for ought they can yet ſee they have yet no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Is there any whoſe hearts the Lord hath ſmitten with the ſad apprehenſions of this Truth, that they are all borne out of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that begin to ſay, <hi>what ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> Loe here is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort yet, though thou beeſt borne for the preſent out of Chriſt, yet poſſibly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93551:49"/> thou mayeſt be borne under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, yea for ought thou knoweſt thou art. Chriſt is the Apple-tree, Chriſt exhibited in his Goſpell, in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, &amp;c. is a glorious Apple-tree, full of ripe Apples, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the hands of every ſoule that doth but lift up his beleeving hand to take and eat. This is certaine, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Gods ſecret will ſhuts out of heaven his revealed will ſhuts out none who doth not ſhut out himſelfe. Come therefore, <hi>Turne, turne, why wilt thou dye O thou ſinfull creature?</hi> For ought thou knoweſt, thou art in no worſe condition than <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> all of them were borne ſuch as thou art. Chriſt cals, <hi>Hoe every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come, &amp;c.</hi> Come then, let not thy ſinnes hinder thee; there's merit enough and mercy enough in him, O let not faith be awanting in thee. Behold, it is now Autumne with us, Autumne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for Goſpell-diſpenſations have been but as green Apples formerly, to the times wherein the Lord hath caſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93551:50"/> our lot, never was there ſuch a plenty of ſoule-enlightening powerfull preaching; plenty enough, the Lord grant we ſurfeit not with it. O reach out an hand, take, eat, live. To encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, conſider how the Lord pleads with you. Some Apple-trees are ſo loaden with fruit, that when the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples grow once to their full quantity, the boughes bend even to the hand of the gatherer: ſuch my friends are our dayes, the boughes loaden with Apples of free Grace, even bend again to your ſoules; O take, eat, and your ſoules ſhall live The Autumne is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. The Goſpell is free, you may take what you will it ſhall coſt you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Chriſt even bends to you loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Apples of Love. Ah! how he reacheth out himſelfe to your ſoules; deſpaire not, only plucke and eat; you are under the Apple-tree.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is there any one here that hath a child, husband, wife, friend, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſiſter, &amp;c. that he can have no comfort concerning, in regard that they can ſee no ſigues of grace in them, let
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93551:50"/> this comfort them yet, they may be under the Apple-tree; though the Lord hath not diſcovered himſelfe yet to their ſoules, yet he may doe it: All the Apples are not gathered off the Tree of Life, it is laden yet; pray, cry for them, mourne for them, the Lord may yet give them an heart to repent. I thinke it was <hi>Ambroſe</hi> told Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> mother, being ſadly lamenting the condition of her ſonne then a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichee: Be of good comfort (ſaith he) it is impoſſible that a ſonne of ſo many teares ſhould periſh. I will not ſay ſo concerning any one, but I will ſay, <hi>vix probabile eſt,</hi> it is ſcarſe probable, that a child or friend of many teares and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould periſh: Give not over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mourning over them, crying, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for them, the Goſpell-day laſts. What though thy friend by his life yet declares himſelfe to be out of Chriſt, yet he may be under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree for ought thou knoweſt, though not upon it, yet under it. Chriſt that ſaw <hi>Nathaniel</hi> under the Fig-tree, may ſee thy child or friend under the Apple-tree,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93551:51"/> and call him, and raiſe him up: it is Chriſts place where he uſeth to raiſe his Elect ones.</p>

                  <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that helpeth his redeemed ones out of their undone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall inlarge and prove this truth in the generall, In theſe particulars, 1. He was deſigned to doe it. 2. He can doe it. 3. He muſt doe it, for none elſe could. 4. He hath done it. 5. He will doe it. After this I ſhall explicate to you the manner how the Lord Chriſt raiſed up his ſervants under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, then thirdly I ſhall give you the reaſons, and laſtly, I ſhall come to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Firſt, in regard that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is propounded indefinitely, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93551:53"/> ſhall prove it to you in ſeverall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which poſſibly may ſome of them beare the force of Reaſons too.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He was deſigned to doe it.</hi> It was a deſigne of Eternity that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſtep out of heaven, and raiſe up his elected ones from their loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore Chriſt is ſaid by the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. To be an High-Prieſt, faithfull to him <hi>that appointed him.</hi> The buſineſſe from Eternity lay thus: Here is man loſt, and here are thoſe amongſt others loſt (ſaith God the Father to his Sonne) that I have given thee for a <hi>portion,</hi> what ſhall be done for man? Well, yet I will ſtudy to doe good to a wretched creature: Thou ſhalt in the fulneſſe of time goe and bee borne of fleſh and bloud, and dye for them, and ſatisfie my juſtice, and they ſhall be thine for a portion; therefore they are called the Lords <hi>Redeemed ones,</hi> Iſa. 35. 9. The holy People, the <hi>redeemed</hi> of the Lord. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 12. This thou ſhalt do (ſaith the Father) and upon theſe termes they ſhall live, believing in thee. This was Gods Covenant with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93551:54"/> the Sonne of his love for us: For it is worth the noting, that though the Covenant of Works was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lord and <hi>Adam</hi> perſonally, yet the Covenant was made with Chriſt, and all us in him myſtically; this the Apoſtle largely proves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>The promiſes were made to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his ſeed: hee ſaies not to ſeeds, as of many, but as of one; And to thy ſeed, which was Chriſt.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made then betwixt God and our repreſentative, The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. God ſayes, thou ſhalt goe and dye for them, and I will yet ſave them, believing in thee. Content, ſaith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I will goe, and fulfill thy pleaſure, and they ſhall bee mine for ever. I will in the fulneſſe of time dye for them, and they ſhall live in me, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 40. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering and Sinne-offering thou haſt not required,</hi> [no it was Self-offering] <hi>Then ſaid I, Loe I come; in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of thy booke it is written of mee,</hi> [to doe thy will, O my God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6.] In what Booke was it written, that Chriſt ſhould come to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93551:54"/> doe the will of God? It was written in Cyphers in the Ceremoniall Law, it was written in plainer Engliſh in the Prophets, But it was written in the Book of Gods Decrees; in this ſenſe, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>The Lamb ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the World.</hi> And in regard of Gods Decree, we may ſay, the Saints were redeemed, pardoned, Juſtified from eternity. His Father from before all time appointed him to be our High-Prieſt, and hee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Eternity ſubſcribed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleaſure in it. Thus from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he raiſed us up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as he was deſigned to doe it, ſo it was not a worke beyond the greatneſſe of his ſtrength: God in doing it, <hi>laid help on one that was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> There was power enough in his mercy, price enough in his merits, to have bought more than the handfull of his redeemed ones out of the hands of the Devill, had they beene to bee ſold. It is a ſlandering thought of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, for me to thinke, <hi>there is no balme in Gilead,</hi> there is no <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93551:55"/> there: though our ſinnes be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet hee that hath helpe laid upon him, is mighty too; and the might of our ſinnes is nothing to the power of his mercies. He was God as well as man: his manhood made him our hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his Godhead made him a Mighty helper, able to pardon all the ſinnes of his Saints, and to furniſh all their ſoules with long white Robes of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Yea, thirdly, Such a worke it was to raiſe us, that it was hee alone that could doe it: all heaven and earth had been at a loſſe for a ſatisfaction for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, if it had not ſatisfied it ſelfe upon it ſelf. See it in Gods word, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>And I looked, and there was none to helpe, and I wondred that there was none to uphold; therefore mine owne arme brought ſalvation to them.</hi> And ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>And he ſaw there was no man, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that there was no interceſſor; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arme brought ſalvation unto him, and his righteouſneſſe ſuſtained him.</hi> He ſaw none would: (And no wonder at that, for none could;) but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93551:55"/> if they could they would not. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would have been like the Prieſt and Levite, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 31, 32. they would have <hi>paſſed by on the other ſide.</hi> Chriſt was he that was the good Samaritane onely, that had compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on us. <hi>Ez.</hi> 16. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>None eye pittied us,</hi> to doe any thing to us that might doe us any good: wee were <hi>caſt out in the open field to the loathing of our perſon in the day wherein we were borne.</hi> But if they would, yet none could. Alas! they had been all Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of no value; man had beene paſt their cure. Here was the ſtate of a poore Creature: An infinite debt was due to infinite juſtice, for mans offence; Alas, where ſhall it be had? as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid concerning wiſedome, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 13, 14. <hi>Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The depth ſaith it is not in mee, and the ſea ſaith it is not with mee, &amp;c.</hi> So may we ſay: The Angels ſaid, it is not in us; for could wee aſſume bodies and dye, yet we were but finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and there could not be an infinite value in our death. Come wee downe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93551:56"/> to the earth, the Beaſts and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay, it is not in us: for is God pleaſed with the deaths of Bullocks, and Goats, and Lambs? Ah, no! what ſayes <hi>David, Thou deſireſt not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, elſe would I give it; thou delighteſt not in burnt Offering.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40 <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou didſt not deſire; Burnt-Offering and Sinne-Offering thou haſt not required.</hi> Beſides, how ſhall the fleſh of Bulls ſatisfie the guilt of another Nature? Man ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not in me: No, <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heale thy ſelfe;</hi> Wee were all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and how ſhould we pay the debt, that if we could have paid our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers debt, had had as great a one for our ſelves to pay? Can that Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor by his ſuffering death, expiate for another, when himſelf deſerves to dye alſo, and ſtands condemned to death for his owne demerits? Beſides, had all man-kinde dyed, they had been but as ſo many Priſoners laid in Gaole for debt that had not a groat to pay; their lying in hell for ever had paid no debts, but ſtill increaſed them. Well, how ſhall the ſatisfaction be made? ſhal we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93551:56"/> buy man off? Alas no, Salvation <hi>canot be gotten for gold, nor ſhall ſilver be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the price of it, it cannot</hi> (as <hi>job</hi> ſayes of wiſedome) <hi>be valued with the gold of Ophyr, with the precious Onyx, or the Saphir: The Gold and the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall cannot equall it, and the exchange of it ſhall not bee for Jewells of fine gold: no mention ſhall bee made of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and of Pearles, for the price of ſalvation is above Rubies. The Topaz of Ethiopia ſhall not equall it, neither ſhall it bee valued with pure gold: whence then commeth ſalvation? and where is the place of it, ſeeing it is hid from all l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ving eyes, and kept cloſe from the Fowles of the aire. Deſtruction and Death ſay, we have heard the fame thereof with our eares. God,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the way thereof, and hee knowes the place thereof.</hi> Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but what was neceſſarily required, of whoſoever ſhould raiſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt, fallen man, and we ſhall finde this plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that if Chriſt had not raiſed us up, we had not been raiſed to this day. I conceive theſe foure things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him that ſhould undertake
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93551:57"/> the raiſing, and redemption of man, in point of Juſtice and Reaſon, ſo as to gaine acceptance with God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>One that could dye:</hi> God had made it his Statute; <hi>The day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bloud would doe it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Without ſhedding bloud there is no remiſſion.</hi> Juſtice muſt have its courſe. Now upon this ſcore, neither any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinity, (as meerely ſo) nor any Angell in Heaven could helpe us; for theſe had no bloud to ſhed: And without ſhedding of bloud there is no pardon, and remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It muſt bee the offending Nature that muſt ſatisfie againe.</hi> God is the Fountain of Juſtice, he will not let the beaſts ſuffer for mans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: <hi>The Lords wayes are equall; The ſoule that ſinneth that ſhall dye. Ezech.</hi> 18. 4. This ſhuts out all the Earth, but man-kinde, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſufficient ſatisfaction to infinite juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It muſt bee one</hi> that can merit and ſatisfie by death: for if by death he barely payes his own debts,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93551:57"/> what becomes of ours? You would laugh at that Debtor, that if himſelfe owes five hundred pound, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake with foure hundred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge both himſelfe and anothers too: or at a Malefactor, that being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe to dye, ſhould offer to his fellow under the ſame condemnation to dye for him. Now upon this ſcore all man-kinde is excluded, from finding out in it ſelfe a ſufficient Saviour: they are all under the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when every one lay under a guilt and condemnation to dye for himſelf, ſurely none could merit for another by dying; eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the Saviour of man was not onely to ſatisfie, but to pay an infinite ſatisfaction. It was was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, an infinite Juſtice that was offended, and muſt be ſatisfied; and a finite ſatisfaction would have been too ſhort a pay for an infinite debt. And now upon this ſcore again are all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſatisfactions excluded. Let them doe their utmoſt, infiniteneſſe is not in them, they have a bottome may bee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93551:58"/> ſeene. Now by this time, me thinkes you ſhould be wondring at mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and crying out, Lord how comes any man ever in heaven? The Text tells you, <hi>I raiſed you.</hi> Chriſt did the worke. Harke, Chriſtian, and I will tell thee, neither heaven nor earth could ſave thee alone: there was nothing in heaven could ſuffer, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on earth could ſatisfie; and as there was no mercy without ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo there could be no ſatisfaction without ſuffering: Heaven and earth therefore muſt bee mingled together. From Heaven we muſt have a ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, from earth a guilty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a ſuffering perſon. God the Father ſayes to Chriſt, thou ſhalt goe and doe it. Chriſt ſayes I goe: It is written that I ſhould do thy will: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is my delight, I am content to doe it. But how ſhall it be done? (ſaith God) <hi>There ſhall ſpring up a branch out of the root of</hi> Jeſſe. <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne;</hi> and that Sonne ſhall be my Sonne; yet my Son ſhall not be her Sonne; he ſhall take unto him the humane Nature, and hee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93551:58"/> ſhall be deſpiſed, ſmitten of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men, full of ſorrowes; yea, he ſhall dye, and by death ſatisfie my wrath. Thus, <hi>in carne patitur Deus creator ne caro creaturae patiatur.</hi> God the Creator ſuffers in the fleſh of the Creature, that the fleſh of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might not ſuffer. <hi>I raiſed thee</hi> (ſaith hee) yes, he did it, when none elſe could doe it: his arme brought ſalvation to us, when every creatures Arme was too ſhort; yea and he did it alone, hee needed no other; his owne merits were enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they were infinite, and they were enough to his Father, for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayes hee was well pleaſed with him; and as he needed none, ſo he had no other, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-preſſe alone, and of the people there was none with me. I raiſed thee</hi> (ſaith hee) yes, it was hee, and he alone: ſo I have made out my third Propoſition. Yet further,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>he hath done it.</hi> This is more than all the Prophets could ſay, they could beleeve that he would raiſe his redeemed ones, wee can ſay he hath done it: He hath raiſed all of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93551:59"/> them meritoriouſly, ſome of them actually. I underſtand by Raiſing, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary condition to our Originall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which <hi>Adam</hi> left us, he hath brought them out of their miſery, who were his elected and redeemed ones; He hath pardoned their ſinnes, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them of their guilt, paid their debts, ſet them cleare againe in Gods books, and this he hath done for all thoſe that are his Spouſes (for to them only he ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>I raiſed thee) meritoriouſly,</hi> when he dyed upon the Croſſe for them: he did it <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> from all Eternity, he gave his word to his Father for the debt that it ſhould be paid upon demand; but when he dyed, he made paiment and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his word; yet he doth not come and proclame the ſoule diſcharged till <hi>juſtification,</hi> when the Lord actually and formally acquits the ſoule from all, and accepts it as perfectly cleare of all accounts due upon any ſcore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to God; and therefore I ſay in the ſecond place, That <hi>ſome he hath raiſed Actually,</hi> that is, Actually and formally juſtified them, pardoning all their ſins, and imputing his owne righteouſneſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93551:59"/> to them, and accepting of them as Righteous for his owne ſake, even for his owne Names ſake. He hath done it meritoriouſly, he ſaid upon the Croſſe, <hi>All is finiſhed;</hi> he bore our griefes, the chaſtilement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we were healed (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. And he hath done it for ſome Actually, having ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified them, Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God:</hi> where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of juſtification, as of a paſt act of grace, concerning the beleeving Romanes, and ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 1. concerning the beleeving Corinthians. And Chriſt is ſtil juſtifying every day all his time is ſpent, either in reading par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons for his redeemed Saints, or in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Petitions from them, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them: <hi>I raiſed thee,</hi> I have done it, and I will doe it. That is my laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>He will doe it.</hi> I meane actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and formally; he hath done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 1. By the engaging of his word to his Father, nay more than ſo, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the price, his father aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not an ace, he paid every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93551:60"/> groat, yea and left a ſurpluſage too, only he hath not taken out their pardon yet; the Actuall and formall diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſome is behind, but they need not feare, it is to come out of courſe, without a farthing more paid, 1 Joh. 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull, and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes.</hi> There is not a farthing more due, and it were injuſtice with God to deny juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that ſue it out by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſinnes, and ſeeking of his face. God ſpeaks of it here therefore as done <hi>[I raiſed thee.]</hi> I take the words to imply the whole reparation of mankind: I meane that part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde whom the Lord had from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity choſen to everlaſting life, and for whom Jeſus Chriſt had paid the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his precious bloud. Chriſt, I ſay, ſpeakes of it here as done, becauſe of the certainty of it. Take onely one place for this, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29. <hi>My ſheep he are my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternall life; and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93551:60"/> 
                     <hi>gave mee them is greater than all, and no man is able to plucke them out of my Fathers hand; I and my Father are one.</hi> Obſerve the thing propoſed, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that is, that thoſe that are Chriſts ſhould never periſh. Now to root this in their mindes, he tells them, 1 That they were <hi>his ſheep,</hi> and hee kew them, they could not bee loſt then, at unawares, and he not miſſe them. 2. They were <hi>his Fathers gifts to him,</hi> therefore they ſhould not be loſt, hee would have a care of his Fathers love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens. 3 But may they not be taken away? No: for 1. He is reſolved to give them <hi>eternall life.</hi> 2. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his ſure word for it: <hi>Neither ſhall any man plucke them out of my hand.</hi> They cannot doe it whether hee will or no; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>my Father which gave them me is greater than all.</hi> Yea and further, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> My owne power, and my fathers pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er united, are ingaged for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Thoſe therefore that are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, though for the preſent they may be out of Chriſt, yet they ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But what I have already ſaid may
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93551:61"/> be enough to prove the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that <hi>it is Jeſus Chriſt that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his elected ones out of their naturall undone condition.</hi> It is hee that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Father to doe it, that can, and that alone could doe it; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt, or none elſe can: that hee hath done it meritoriouſly for all his Elect, and actually for ſome of them, and that in his due time he will do it actually and formally for all. Now for a little further explication and clearing of this truth, let us examine how hee hath done, or will doe it? To that queſtion I ſhall anſwer in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and indeed the anſwer may be drawne out of what I have already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he did it, <hi>[ſtipulatione.]</hi> by entring into a Covenant, and engaging his word for us: The Covenant of Grace (from which flowes all ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to poore Creatures) was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally made with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as I before prooved from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15, 16. Chriſt engaged himſelfe to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the fulfilling of the Law, and ſatisfying his Fathers wrath for us:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93551:61"/> and hence it is, that the Prophet ſayes, ſpeaking Prophetically concerning the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> Iſaiah 53. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. &amp; Iſa. 53. 6. <hi>He hath laid upon him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all.</hi> &amp; <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Hee was bruiſed for our iniquities.</hi> With what Juſtice could God our Father lay our iniquities upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Chriſt was a guiltleſſe perſon, nor could wee engage him in our cauſe; but it was a voluntary engagement that himſelfe entred to his Father. As it is with us; A poore Debtor is ready to be arreſted for a debt that he is not able to pay, there is no way but one, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pay or to priſon: Let him have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo rich, and great friends, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor cannot charge a farthing of the Debt upon them, it is no Juſtice. But if this poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Debtor hath ſome rich friend that will ſtep in and ſay, Sir, this is my friend, I pray bee patient with him, I will undertake for the debt, I will engage my word and bond, that the debt ſhall bee paid at ſuch a time, or when you will pleaſe to call for it, &amp;c. The Creditor it may be will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93551:62"/> be ſo favourable as to ſay, Sir, I know you are able to do it, if you will engage your word, I ſhall ſpare your friend; pay it at ſuch a time, or when you will ſet the time, and I will acquit your friend. The engagement is entred in the Creditors Book, and from that day forward the Creditor looks upon this his Debtors friend, as now by his own voluntary engagement become his Debtor, and never regards his old Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor more. This is our caſe, <hi>Adam</hi> had runne us in debt, an infinite debt, which neither he nor we are able to pay; A Writ of Vengeance was out, mankinde ready to bee arreſted and bound in Chaines, and throwne into an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting priſon, from whence hee ſhould have been ſure never to come out, till hee had paid the utermoſt farthing, which he could never have done with all the friends and eſtate he could have made: Jeſus Chriſt ſeeing ſome of his elected friends that his Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, having their names in the Writ, ſteps in and ſayes, Father, theſe are my friends, Iſa. 63. 8. <hi>Surely they are my people, children that will not lye,</hi>

                     <hi>ſo he was their Saviour)</hi> I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their debt upon me, charge it upon my ſcore, I will pay every farthing, if thou pleaſeſt to accept it, it ſhall be paid at ſuch a time, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeeme them that were under the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Adoption of ſonnes.)</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepts this tender: therefore he is ſtiled, Gods beloved Sonne, <hi>in whom he is well pleaſed.</hi> The word is <hi>[in whom</hi>

                     </gap>] An emphaticall word, which generally ſignifies to love, but more ſpecially, and properly, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to love ſomething by adhering to it with the minde and heart, and ſo to be content, and fully ſatisfied with it, that one deſires nothing elſe. Me thinks I cannot but obſerve three things in it. 1. God ſignifies by it that he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, and with his tender: As if wee ſhould ſay, I like that well. 2. God ſignifies by it, that he is fully content with him, ſo that hee deſires nothing elſe: As if we ſhould ſay, <hi>I deſire no better ſecurity than his,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93551:63"/> 3. God doth ſignifie by it, that he will truſt to it: As it we ſhould ſay, in ſuch a caſe to a ſurety, Well then, <hi>I will no more look after my Debtor, now I will truſt to you onely.</hi> So upon Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, ſaith God, <hi>I like thy tender as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and am ſo fully content with it, that I deſire no more, but now I ſhall wholly truſt to thee for all.</hi> Now God repeateth theſe words in the Goſpell at Chriſts Baptiſme, and at Chriſts Transfiguration, <hi>Matth</hi> 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. And to what purpoſe? but to witneſſe to the world, as that hee was well pleaſed <hi>with Chriſt as his Sonne,</hi> that in heaven, his worke was to delight in his Sonne; and he did ſo delight in him, that he deſireth no other pleaſure than the company and beholding of his Sonne, (which puts me in minde of a ſweet notion of Maſter <hi>Rutherfords,</hi> that God ſpent all his time from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, till the Creation of the World, in delighting himſelfe in Chriſt.) But I ſay, as it doth ſignifie that, and ſo ſet out the infinite love of the Father, that he would be pleaſed to part with ſuch a darling of glory for us: as alſo in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93551:63"/> this it ſets out the Fathers love, that he ſhould ſend to looke after inglorious wretches, when hee needed not our companies; for hee had pleaſure and delight enough in the company of his Eternall Sonne; whoſe company did ſo content him, that he deſired nothing elſe for himſelfe. So I alſo thinke, that God by his twice repeating of it, after Chriſt came, would have us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that God was well pleaſed with him <hi>as our Surety,</hi> with what <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. Chriſt is called our Surety.</note> payment hee ſhould make, &amp;c. But now, in regard it was in time, that Chriſt came <hi>in the fulneſſe time</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. How did the Lord Jeſus make our paiment ſure? I anſwer, <hi>By engaging his word.</hi> God the Father had nothing but the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts word, for the paiment of all the Elects debts, not from eternity, till Chriſt came and made payment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his engagement. Now thus hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt raiſed us out of our loſt condition, by engaging his word, and entring into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did it <hi>Aſſumptione carnis,</hi> By
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93551:64"/> aſſuming of our fleſh. He made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with his Father for us from all Eternity. But hee tooke out this Bond in time, canceling it with his owne bloud: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Galatians</hi> Chapt. 4. Verſe 4. <hi>God in the fulneſſe of time, ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, born under the Law, to Redeem thoſe that were under the Law, that they might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> He could Covenant for us as God, but he muſt dye for us as man: In the fulneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of time, he bowed the heavens, and came downe, and tooke upon him our fleſh, not changing the Godhead into fleſh, neither confounding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, nor the Natures, but perſonally uniting of them, that the two Natures became one Perſon, and ſo he became a Saviour fit to raiſe us. Now to him that raiſed, this was neceſſary, 1. <hi>That juſtice might be done.</hi> It had been no juſtice in God to have charged the guilt of one Nature upon another. Gods wayes appeare equall in charging the guilt upon the guilty, <hi>Ez.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch then as the children</hi> [whom he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93551:64"/> came to redeeme] <hi>were partakers of fleſh and bloud: he alſo tooke part with them, that through death he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the power of death, even the Devill.</hi> Heb. 2. 14. and ver. 17. <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like to his brethren,</hi> and why, ver. 16. <hi>He had taken upon him the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> [that is, the guilt of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſatisfie for them.] 2. It was requiſite, <hi>That he might be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full High-prieſt,</hi> faithfull to his word. You ſhall obſerve it, that Chriſt gives it as a great reaſon of his condeſcentions, and actions of Grace; <hi>That all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe may be fulfilled, and that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt is tender of his Fathers Truth: Now God had ſaid, that the womans ſeed ſhould bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And though by <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed was ſpiritually meant Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15, 16. to whom the Promiſes were made, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes had not been fulfilled if that Chriſt had not alſo been <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 17. one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given why the Lord Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93551:65"/> man, and tooke part of fleſh and bloud with us, <hi>that he might be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full High-prieſt.</hi> 3. It was requiſite that he ſhould thus raiſe us, <hi>that he might fulfill the Law for us.</hi> Now the Law was to be fulfilled two wayes, 1. Actively. 2. Paſſively. Neither could have been done without the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our fleſh. There is not ſuch a contradiction between the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Works, as ſome ignorant Libertines would this day make: God gave a Law, and his Covenant was, <hi>doe this and live;</hi> this is that which we call the Covenant of Works, man could not doe it. What is Gods mind altered now? no ſuch matter, God ſayes, <hi>Doe this and live ſtill, and if you doe not this you ſhall dye.</hi> It was written long ſince that time, Deut. 27. ver. 26. <hi>Curſed be he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them.</hi> And all the people muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it now as well as they did then. But herein is the Covenant of Grace more favourable: The Covenant of Works ſayes, thou ſhalt perſonally doe them or dye; The Covenant of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93551:65"/> Grace ſayes, thou ſhalt doe it, or get Chriſt to doe it for thee. the Covenant of Workes ſayes, I will take no baile; no ſurety, doe it or dye: <hi>Durus eſt hic ſermo;</hi> an hard ſaying, who can heare it? The Covenant of Grace ſaith, Get me Chriſts Baile, and I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit thee, if thou beleeveſt in him. Therfore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>As many as are of the workes of the Law,</hi> that look to be juſtified by their owne workes, by their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in fulfilling the Law, <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe:</hi> for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the Law to doe them.</hi> Look to it, (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) if you look to be juſtified by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the Law in your owne perſons, take my word for it, you have an hard taske. But <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from the curſe of the Law.</hi> But how was that? it followes in the next words. <hi>Being made a curſe for us,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hee was to fulfill the Law Actively, that he might fulfill what we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93551:66"/> through the weaknes of the fleſh could not, and in regard that he was to fulfill it for us, it was requiſite he ſhould have our nature; and as hee was to fulfill the Law Actively, ſo in regard that his Elect by their paſt Tranſgreſſions had broken the Law of God, <hi>Adam</hi> for himſelfe and all his poſterity, and the body of death which (he knew) was to remaine after ſanctification in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ones, would lay them open to hell, He alſo was to fulfill the Law <hi>Paſſively</hi> for us; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, He hath redeemed us from the <hi>eurſe</hi> of the Law. Now he tells you how that was <hi>verſe</hi> 13. by being made a curſe for us, as it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangs upon a tree.</hi> Now hee could not have been in capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to the curſe of the Law, by hanging upon the tree for us, unleſſe he had taken upon him our fleſh. Nay, yet a</p>
                  <p>Fourth Reaſon may be given, why it was neceſſary that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould raiſe up his redeemed ones by the aſſuming their fleſh. <hi>viz. That he might be a mercifull High-Prieſt.</hi> It
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93551:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> is the Reaſon that the Apoſtle gives, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to bee made like unto his brethren, that hee might bee a mercifull and faithfull High-Prieſt in all things pertaining to God, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſinnes of the people; for in that hee himſelfe ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> I ſhall adde nothing to it. Thus he raiſed us by Aſſuming of our fleſh, which in order to our raiſing it was neceſſary for him to doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He raiſed us <hi>Paſſione,</hi> by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious death upon the Croſſe; his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was our riſing, his life our death <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes wee are healed.</hi> His owne bloud was the balme from <hi>Gilead,</hi> as well as himſelfe the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an there. Now in order to the raiſing of his Elect ones, it was requiſite that he ſhould dye. 1. <hi>That he might ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</hi> 2. <hi>That he might conquer.</hi> 1. That he might ſatisfie and <hi>purchaſe Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> He that will redeem any ſlave out of Captivity muſt pay the ſumme of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93551:67"/> Redemption-money required. Now Death was that which could alone ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the redeemed ones. It was the Lords firſt Law, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> temporally, and eternally. Now a death muſt be paid, or juſtice is not ſatisfied, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Without blood there is no remiſſion:</hi> he therefore, <hi>dyed for our ſinnes</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, he was our ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. And he is no ſacrifice till ſlaine. This was typified by the ſlaying of beaſts for ſacrifices in the old Law, which God required of all thoſe that would obtain pardon. And in regard that man had deſerved hell as well as death, Chriſt by dying that he might raiſe us, and and make the face of God againe to ſhine upon us, was content to ſuffer the withdrawings of his Fathers love, and to feele as it were the paines of hell to raiſe us to the joyes of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it was neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our raiſing, that Chriſt ſhould dye, to the intent that he ſhould ſatisfie for us, ſo it was alſo neceſſary that he ſhould dye, <hi>that he might conquer for</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93551:67"/> 
                     <hi>us.</hi> This the Apoſtle fully expreſſeth, Heb. 2. 14, 15. <hi>Foraſmuch as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelfe tooke part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that hath the power of death, even the Devill, and deliver them, who through feare of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage.</hi> Chriſt was to lead Captivity captive, to take away deaths ſting, and hels victory, which he could not have done without wraſtling with death himſelfe; had he not been deaths captive, he had never been deaths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. Hee raiſed us by dying for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath raiſed us, <hi>Reſurrectione,</hi> by riſing againe from the dead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 4. 25. <hi>He was delivered to death for our offences, and roſe againe for our juſtification.</hi> Now his Reſurrection had and hath an influence upon raiſing his Elect ones, 1. By witneſſing to them Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for them, and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes the worke of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for us to be proper to his death, and the worke of our <hi>juſtification</hi> he appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93551:68"/> to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. When he dyed, he went downe that he might conquer; but it was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up out of the grave that witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his conqueſt over death and hell. It was in that day that this Song was ſung, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting! O hell, where is thy victory!</hi> When the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is freed, it is a ſigne the debt is paid or the Gaoler beaten: It was a ſigne of both in Chriſt, as that the debt was paid due to his Fathers juſtice, ſo alſo that death and hell were beaten. 2. Chriſts Reſurrection had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our raiſing, <hi>by quickning us,</hi> Col. 2. 12. <hi>Buried with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, wherein you are alſo riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead. And being dead in your ſinnes hath be quickned, together with him, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; Col. 3. 1. <hi>If then ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above:</hi> and ver. 2. <hi>Set your affections on things which are above,</hi> &amp;c. We are riſen <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> with him, and this ſhould quicken us, and ſtrength derived from Chriſts Reſurrection by faith, doth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93551:68"/> quicken the Saints of God, to live to God, as becomes the redeemed ones of the Lord.—3. It hath an influence upon our raiſing, <hi>by being a pledge to us of our owne riſing unto everlaſting glorie,</hi> to live with that Chriſt who was dead, and is alive againe. This the Apoſtle fully proves in that fifteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from the thirteenth Verſe to the five and twentieth. Now I take by raiſing <hi>[I raiſed thee]</hi> not onely to be underſtoed of the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo all the privileges that from that worke of Redemption flow out of courſe to the ſervants of God, being but as ſeverall ſteps from one of which to another the Saint is raiſed, till hee bee got to the toppe ſtaire of glory. Chriſt hath raiſed us by his owne riſing from the pit of the grave.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath raiſed us by his <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and ſitting at the right hand of his Father. Now Chriſts Aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of the Father, hath an influence upon our <hi>raiſing,</hi> theſe wayes.—1. <hi>In going before hee</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93551:69"/> 
                     <hi>provides a place for us.</hi> Take this out of his owne mouth, <hi>John</hi> 14. 2. <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you. And if I goe, and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receive you unto my ſelfe, that where I am there you may be alſo.</hi> Chriſt is now preparing Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his redeemed ones; for in his Fathers houſe are many Manſions: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Saint of his ſhall want a ſeat, or a roome in glory.—2. In going he hath raiſed us in being our <hi>Way.</hi> He being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and with the Father, wee have through him a way unto the Father, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>I am the way;</hi> hee was the way by which the Father came to us; he communicated himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in, and by, and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and hee is our way by which wee goe to God, whatſoever we aske <hi>in his Name,</hi> if we believe we ſhall receive it, we ſhall receive it. The Saint could not pray with comfort, if he did not remember that <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>There is an Angell that ſtands before the Throne, to whom much Incenſe is given, to offer up the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto God.</hi> But knowing we have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93551:69"/> a friend in the Court, we offer up our prayers with boldnes, and a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his goodneſſe.—3. His Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion hath an influence upon our rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>in that wee know now we have an Advocate with the Father, even Chriſt.</hi> Alas, with what comfort can the child of God, whoſe conſcience the Lord hath awakened to conſider his daily ſinnes and corruptions, thinke upon God, or look up unto God, if he did not know Chriſt were with him? But now, that Chriſt is with his Father, wee know, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>That if any man ſinne wee have an Advocate with the Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chriſt the righteous.</hi> Hebr. 7. 25. He is therefore <hi>able to ſave them to the utmoſt that come unto God through him;</hi> becauſe <hi>he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them,</hi> Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. yea and <hi>verſe</hi> 34. Now, <hi>Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand, who alſo maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us.</hi> Obſerve there how the Apoſtle gives Chriſt aſcenſion and ſitting at the hand of God, as the proximate cauſe of our Interceſſor:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93551:70"/> his Death and Reſurrection made him not our Interceſſor, his Death made him our Saviour, his Reſurrection our Conqueror, but his Aſcenſion and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand of God, hath ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately made him in a capacity to bee our Advocate, and Interceſſor: Thus he hath raiſed us by Aſcenſion.—Yea, 4. His Aſcenſion and ſitting at the right hand of the Father, hath an influence upon our raiſing, <hi>in that now from thence he giveth gifts unto men,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. <hi>When hee aſcended up on high, he led Captivity Captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 68. 18. (from whence that paſſage is taken) ſaith he received gifts for men; he received them from his Father. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, when hee <hi>led Captivity Captive,</hi> he diſtributed theſe to men: As Conquerors uſe when they have taken the ſpoile, to deale it out in gifts. What gifts? The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it in part <hi>ver.</hi> 11. He gave ſome to be <hi>Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts.</hi> In ſhort, I take to be meant by it, all the gifts of Gods Spirit, whether of common, or ſpeciall grace,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93551:70"/> whether externall or internall, gifts for the benefit of the Church, and gifts for the benefit of our ſoules: Nay, the deſcending of the Spirit was a fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion. See it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I goe away; for if I goe not away the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will ſend him unto you.</hi> Now it is plaine, that the internall gifts of the Spirit, and workes of it, are fruits of Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion as well as the more common and externall gifts, given in the dayes of Pentecoſt, from the 14. of <hi>Joh. ver.</hi> 16. where Chriſt promiſeth them that the comforter which upon his departure he would ſend to them ſhould <hi>abide with them for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſhewed you now, what courſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath taken to raiſe his redeemed ones, that had loſt all their life, and ſtrength, and comfort in <hi>Adam,</hi> out of this their loſt condition: thus he did it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Theſe were his acts for us. But now to what purpoſe is all this for any ſoules wounds, that there is Balme
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93551:71"/> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> that there is a Phiſitian there, without the Balme bee applyed to its ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly therefore, as Chriſt hath meritoriouſly thus raiſed the whole number of the Elect ones; ſo he Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and Actually raiſeth each one of thoſe whom hee hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his bloud, <hi>by applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto each of their ſoules.</hi> Now for the manner of this Application, the bleſſed Apoſtle deſcribes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Moreover, whom hee did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified:</hi> under Predeſtination is included Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Sanctification under Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now therfore a little to open this myſterie of our Redemption, in the Application of it to the ſoules of them that ſhall be ſaved. You have ſeen how there came to be Balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and that there is a fulneſſe and ſufficiency in Chriſt. Now what doth the poore Elect one want that it hath loſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> I conceive three things, 1. Life. 2. Strength. 3. Light. 1. <hi>Life.</hi> It is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93551:71"/> a damned Creature in <hi>Adam,</hi> it wants a way of ſalvation, a pardon for its ſinnes, a righteouſneſſe to appeare in the ſight of God. 2. <hi>Adam hath left it a weak creature,</hi> not able to do any thing that is good; no not ſo much as to think a good thought: it wants a ſtrength to Act in, ſo as to pleaſe God. 3. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam hath left it a comfortleſſe creature,</hi> without any light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhining upon it. Now all theſe are purchaſed. The firſt of them is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to give the firſt being to a Saint. The ſecond is neceſſary, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Chriſtians being. The third, <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> for the comfortable being of all. Chriſt is all to the Childe of of God, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 27. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. But how doth Chriſt apply theſe to the ſoules of his redeemed ones? 1. Saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>He calls them.</hi> We ſay that in effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, which is when God joynes the irreſiſtable power of his Spirit, with the outward preaching of the Word, God doth theſe three things. 1. <hi>Convince the ſoule of his elect veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi> (that is a child of wrath by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as well as others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3.)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93551:72"/> what a condition it is in by reaſon of its Originall, and its Actuall ſinnes. 2. <hi>Humble the ſoule</hi> for its ſinnes, and diſcover unto the ſoule the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all its owne righteouſneſſe, that it is undone in its ſinnes, and undone in its righteouſneſſe: and thirdly, hee ſayes to the ſoule, <hi>Yet there is hope,</hi> looke up to me and live; I am as the brazen Serpent, onely looke up, and thou ſhalt live. And that the ſoule may be able to look up with a true eye, Chriſt gives faith to the ſoule, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, come unto him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him by a true reſting, and relying upon his Merits for ſalvation. 2. And having thus Called the ſoule, he then <hi>juſtifies it:</hi> He hath in his Decree ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified it from eternity; hee hathmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly juſtified it by his Death upon the Croſſe; but now hee doth actually and formally juſtifie it. 1. By pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its ſinnes, and acquitting the ſoule from the obligation it till now lay under to death, and forgetting the injury done to himſelfe by any of its ſinnes. 2. By imputing the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, to the ſoule;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93551:72"/> by which it appeares, the ſinner is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, not without a ſatisfaction firſt given to Juſtice. 3. By accepting gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly the ſoule thus juſtified as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, as if it had never ſinned. And the worke of true faith in this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is to lay hold upon it. And thus now, Chriſt applyes the merits of his Death to the ſoule, in conveying life and pardon to it: thus hee raiſeth it, ſaying to it in its bloud, live. But this is not all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſoule is weake, and is not able to live an houre of it ſelfe; Chriſt therefore in the next place, in order to its more perfect raiſing, ſanctifies the ſoule: which implyeth two things. 1. He gives unto the ſoule new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of grace, 2. He gives the ſoule power to act theſe principles, for as (except from him) we have nothing, ſo without him we can doe nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. Which power being given the ſoule from above, the ſoule is raiſed, and becomes ſtrong in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and ſets upon works, 1. Of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to ſubdue the ſtrong holds of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93551:73"/> Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> the remainder of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſoule. 2. Of Vivification, ſetting upon ſuch Duties as God hath required of his redeemed ones, being exerciſes of the grace which they have received from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he gives the ſoule power to live upon faith, to love, to deſire him, to delight in him, to do, and to ſuffer for him, to be content with him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and thirdly, In his due time he raiſes the ſoule to a comfortable life, in giving it the ſenſe of his love, a perſwaſion of its Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, peace in the inward man, ſhining upon it with the light of his Countenance, which is better to it than thouſands of Gold and Silver. This I ſay he does in his due time, not to all, nor continuing it conſtantly to any, but according to his good pleaſure; thus making knowne to it the Redemption he hath purchaſed for it, and the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of its ſoule which is paſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, in his due time he will yet further raiſe the ſoule, by taking it to himſelf, and glorifying it with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93551:73"/> for ever. He will come againe on purpoſe to raiſe the ſoules of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones from the duſt, and to take them up to himſelf in glory, that where he is there they may be alſo, <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. Thus Chriſt hath meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed all his redeemed ones; and will apply their Redemption with the fruits of it to them in his due time; applying life to them by Vocation, and Juſtification, ſtrength to them by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, light and comfort to them by ſhining with the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon them, and finally giving them Glorification; hee ſhall then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his worke of raiſing us, and wee ſhall live with him in the Higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens for ever. I have now done with the Doctrinall part, ſo farre as to ſhew you, 1. That it is Chriſt that raiſeth his Elect ones. 1. He is deſigned. 2. He can doe it. 3. Hee onely can. 4. Hee hath done it meritoriouſly for all. 5. Hee hath done it actually and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally for ſome, and will doe it for the reſt. And ſo farre as to ſhew you the manner how he did it, and doth it; both in reſpect of his owne acts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93551:74"/> to the fitting himſelfe for the worke, and in reſpect of his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the ſoules of his ſervants. If now you aske me the Reaſons, why, and to what end he did it? for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the particular Propoſitions, I have given you them before. Now for Reaſons in the Generall, I ſhall give you them in two words.</p>

You have had to doe with that juſt man, Chriſtians, not to doe with condemning him, but even with the vildeſt acts of Barbariſme were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93551:76"/> done unto him; your hypocriſie was the kiſſe that betrayed him; the ſinnes of your hands and feet were the nailes that faſtened his hands and feet to the Croſſe; the ſinnes of your body were the Spears that pierced his ſacred ſide; the ſinnes of your ſoules were they that made his ſoule heavy to the death, that cauſed the with-drawings of his Fathers love from him, and made him in the heavineſſe of his panged ſoule to cry out. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> O ſit downe, goe alone, weep, and weep bitterly for him whom you have pierced; for thoſe ſtripes by which you are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

Chriſtian, thou wert loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, thou wert in <hi>Adams</hi> loines as well as any, thou hadſt an adventure in his ſhip as well as any, the ſhip was wrackt. Did the Lord ever call thee? Didſt thou ever yet find a powerfull worke of Gods ſpirit (joyned with the word) upon thy heart? Did the Lord ever make thee in any meaſure to ſee thy loſt condition? Did the Lord ever yet bid thee (when thou ſaweſt thy ſelfe loſt, and wert confounded in thy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93551:81"/> owne inſufficiency) looke upon Jeſus Chriſt and live? Was ſinne ever yet a ſting to thy ſoule? if not, I doubt (yea I am out of doubt) Chriſt was never a true comfort to thee. Chriſt was lift up as the brazen ſerpent; now for whom was that lift up, but for thoſe that felt the ſmart of the fiery ſerpent? and no way elſe be cured. Againe, Chriſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies before he glorifies, he hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us to good works, and then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine everlaſting life (though not for them) this is Chriſts method of raiſing. Doſt thou looke to be ſaved? Art thou ſanctified Chriſtian? Is thy heart chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thy tongue changed? Beleeve it, no uncleane thing ſhall ever enter into the new Jeruſalem. Chriſt uſeth to raiſe to holineſſe, before he raiſeth to happineſſe. But I have in the former Doctrine ſpake ſo fully to this worke of Examination, in relation to this thing (of ſo great a concernment to every ſoule as nothing can be more) that I ſhall now adde no more, but paſſe on.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93551:81"/> 1. To thoſe that yet have no part at all in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 2. To thoſe that through free grace have an intereſt in this Saviour, and have been raiſed by him.—1. Is there any poore ſoule here, that is to this day ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as that it hath no portion in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Now I beſeech you as an Ambaſſador of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as in Chriſts ſtead, I beſeech you get an intereſt in him. You have heard, he is he whom the Lord hath ordain'd to be the Saviour of the world; he is the mighty one, upon whom help was laid, yea the only mighty one upon whom help could be laid: O then, above all things, looke for a portion in him in whom alone you can be rich. Wouldſt thou be ſaved? This all deſire; Glory and happineſſe are fine things, <hi>Omnibus in voto,</hi> every man would dye the death of the Righteous, and have his later end like his; Wouldſt thou goe to Heaven Chriſtian? he is the way: Wouldſt thou live? he is the life, yea, he, and none but he. Be aſſured, thou art now a child of wrath, and there is but an haires breadth betwixt thee and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93551:82"/> hell; thou art wounded, paſt the cure of the whole Creation, loe here is balme in Gilead: <hi>If thou wilt enquire, enquire, returne, come.</hi> Were there a poore wretch ſicke of an incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to ordinary Phyſitians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, and ſome rare one ſhould come to the Towne, that alone had found out the myſtery in the Art of curing that very trouble, he ſhould be throng'd with Patients: How is it that Chriſt hath no more practiſe? he that is the great Phyſitian, that all the creatures are Phyſitians of no value to him? Alas, the reaſon is too perſpicuous; men are ſenſible of their bodily troubles, but their ſoul-troubles are not felt by them. To direct thee a little to him; wert thou ſicke of ſuch a diſeaſe, and hadſt heard of ſo rare a Phyſitian, what wouldſt thou aske? 1. How ſhall I ſpeake with him? 2. What muſt I give him? 3. How muſt I apply his phyſicke? 4. What Rules of diet or walking, &amp;c. muſt I obſerve? 1. <hi>Doſt thou aske how thou ſhalt ſpeake with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to lay open thy ſoules wounds unto him?</hi> And where doth he exhibite his balme?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93551:82"/> I anſwer to thee: <hi>The word is near thee, even in thy mouth, it is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> Behold, Chriſt keeps open ſhop: <hi>Wiſedome cries and Underſtanding puts forth her voice, ſhe ſtandeth in the top of the high Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the way in the places of the paths. She cries at the gates, at the entring in of the doores. Unto you (O men) ſhe cals, and her voice is to the ſonnes of men. O ye ſimple underſtand wiſedome, and ye fooles be of an underſtanding heart,</hi> Prov. 8. ver. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The Lord Chriſt keeps open ſhop in every place. <hi>We as the Embaſſadors of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, intreat you to be reconciled to God.</hi> Did ever ſuch naturall balme goe on begging? The word is neare thee, there Chriſt offers himſelfe. Doſt thou aske what is his price: 2. <hi>He offers it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Heare the Market proclamed, and the price ſet, Iſa. 55. 1, 2. <hi>Hoe every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy, and eat, wine and milke without money, and without price.</hi> This is the condition, <hi>bring nothing;</hi> the way to have thy ſacke filled as full as thou canſt carry it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93551:83"/> is to bring it empty: Only <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>live,</hi> look up, and be healed; was there ever ſo cheap a Market, of ſo rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities? Chriſtian, poore Chriſtian, wert thou but ſenſible of thy ſoules wants, thou wouldſt give as many thouſand worlds (if thou hadſt them, and they could be given) as there are graines of duſt upon the face of the earth, to have a portion in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Imagine but what a poore damned wretch would give to have but ſo much liberty, as to caſt up a long looke to Heaven; what a comfort it would be to them, if the light of the Goſpell might but ſhine into hell a few dayes? And is mercy offered freely? mayeſt thou be ſaved if thy owne cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will were not in the way? Ah (Chriſtian) turne, turne, why ſhould thy ſoule dye, when there is balme in Gilead, and ſo glorious a Phyſitian there? Doſt thou aske <hi>how muſt I apply his bloud?</hi> 3. I anſwer, only by <hi>Faith.</hi> God ſo loved the world (ſaith the Apoſtle) that whoſoever <hi>beleeveth</hi> in him ſhould not periſh but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: Nay to ſpeake lower yet,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93551:83"/> on thy part is only required <hi>a ſeeking of Chriſts face.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſeeke my face and live.</hi> The truth of it is, as the merit was Chriſts, ſo the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is his too; <hi>Faith</hi> is required, but it is a gift infuſed, <hi>it is the gift of God:</hi> Indeed it is an act too, but as ſo, it is Gods gift, I meane the ſtrength by which thou muſt act, <hi>He is the Author and finiſher of our faith</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.)</hi> O therefore cry, cry mightily unto God (he will help thee doe this too.) Goe alone and wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with God, and take no anſwer without Chriſt, cry, and take no deniall, like the blind man, that when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples diſcouraged him, and Chriſt ſeemed to ſlight him, cryed yet the more earneſtly, till the Lord ſaid, <hi>What wilt thou?</hi> And he anſwered, <hi>Lord that I might receive my ſight.</hi> Goe thou and doe likewiſe, beg, <hi>Lord, that I might be waſhed with thy bloud;</hi> Lord, that my ſinnes might be pardoned; though thou meeteſt with diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thou thinkeſt that thou art one that art a dog, to whom the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread muſt not be given, yet leave
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93551:84"/> not, beg againe but for a crumme of mercy, a drop of bloud, verily thou ſhalt not goe away without comfort. 4. There is but one Querie more. What Rules muſt I obſerve in the uſing of his phyſicke: To this Chriſt hath ſhaped an anſwer for me, <hi>Goe thy way, ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi> Thou muſt take heed that thou doſt not returne againe with the dog to the vomit, and the ſwine to the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire. <hi>He that is borne of God ſinneth not,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, not conſtantly, nor wilfully, but weakly. This for direction: And remember this laſt, which I ſhall conclude with that of the Prophet, Ez. 18. 24. <hi>If the Righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſſe, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? all his righteouſneſſe that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned, in his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſe that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſinne that he hath ſinned, ſhall he dye, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Shall I need adde any thing for motive? I ſhould thinke not, but only call upon you to get eyes to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93551:84"/> ſee your ſad and undone condition in which you are. It is no wonder that you ſhould ſay, we have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when you thinke you are rich. Get but a true underſtanding, 1. Of your owne vile and undone condition, what an hell you carry about with you. 2. What an hell you tread over every day, and it will be enough to pricke on your ſoules to ſeeke a portion in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: eſpecially, if yee well conſider (what I have ſufficiently proved to you) that it is impoſſible that in Heaven and earth there ſhould be found any way of ſalvation for your poore ſoules but in himſelfe. Now the Lord worke theſe things upon your hearts. 2. Give me leave now to ſpeake a word of Exhortation to you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to whom the Lord hath of his free grace given a portion in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you are become his raiſed, <hi>redeemed ones.</hi> The duty which I ſhall in generall preſſe upon you, is thankfulneſſe. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, he remembred you in your low eſtate, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> O what ſhall ye render? Chriſtians,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93551:85"/> what can ye render to the Lord for this mercy? For Motives, Conſider but every word of the Text apart, and methinks it ſhould be Motive enough to prevaile with thoſe that have any thing taſted of this heavenly gift.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>[I.]</hi> To open this word a little, and ſhew you what there is in it to melt your hearts into obedience. 1. <hi>I that was infinitely above thee.</hi> Chriſt was the brightneſſe of his Fathers Image, God bleſt for ever, even from all Eternity. He was from Eternity, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>unice dilectus,</hi> the only beloved of his Father, in whom his Father tooke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite delight; he was the Prince of glory, God bleſt for ever. Now for an Eternall God to ſtoop to a poore worme: O mercy! for a King to viſit an Hoſpitall, to come with his owne hands and dreſſe the putrified wounds of his meaneſt ſubject, it is a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention ſcarſe found amongſt the ſons of men, and yet if you could find it, it ſhould come infinitely ſhort of this condeſcention. 2. <hi>I that did not at all need thee.</hi> The Lord ſtood not in need of a worme, the Father was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93551:85"/> with the Sonne from all Eternity, and taken up with delighting himſelfe in him, and the Sonne was againe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Father. They had an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a ſelf-ſufficiency of glory, and were enough each of them to other; had it not been his bowels of mercy that had yerned towards thee for thy good, he had never been moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee from any other principle. 3. <hi>I whom thou hadſt offended.</hi> Greater love than this is not found amongſt men, than for one to dye for his friend, yet greater love than this hath Chriſt ſhewne, that he dyed for his enemy, Rom. 5. 8. <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man ſome will dare to dye. But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love to us-ward, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> O love! infinite! unfadomable love!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider the Act with its circumſtances. <hi>I raiſed</hi> thee, 1. <hi>Out</hi> of a low condition. What lower than hell? that was thy portion Chriſtian, thou wert <hi>a child of wrath by nature even as others: He remembred thee in</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93551:86"/> 
                     <hi>thy low eſtate; his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> 2. <hi>To a glorious condition.</hi> It is an eſtate more glorious than thy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate was or could be miſerable, to be <hi>free men</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, Rom. 6. 18. into marvellous <hi>light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. to to be <hi>children,</hi> and if <hi>children then heirs of God, and joynt-heires with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. <hi>Heires of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. <hi>Heires of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Heb. 11. 9. <hi>Heires of the Kingdome,</hi> Jam. 2. 5. <hi>Ye which in times paſt were not a people, are now the people of God, you that had not obtained mercy, have now obtained mercy, and are become,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 10, 11. <hi>A choſen Generation, a royall Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people:</hi> wherefore is it, but <hi>that you ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſſe into marvellous light?</hi> 3. He raiſed you by his owne falling, yes, nothing elſe could doe it; <hi>Without bloud there had been no remiſſion,</hi> Heb 9. 22. His owne ſoule muſt be grieved to the death, that your ſoules might be comforted; He muſt be <hi>ſmitten, deſpiſed, rejected of men,</hi> that <hi>the chaſtiſement of your peace</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93551:86"/> 
                     <hi>might be upon him, and by his ſtripes you might be healed.</hi> Was ever love like his?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider it further, in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Act, <hi>I raiſed thee.</hi> 1. <hi>Thee, not others;</hi> Thee, not Angels: Thee, not many other men. 1. Not Angels, yet the Angels were far more glorious creatures, which (if raiſed) had ſinned no more, but ſpent their time in ſinging forth his glory, and ſerving him with cheerfull readineſſe all their dayes, yet Heb. 2. 16. <hi>He in no wiſe took upon him the Nature of Angels, but he tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> 2. If the Lord would have choſen men, might not he have choſen ten thouſand more great, more noble, more wiſe, that in a carnall eye were by Nature cut out far more fit to have made veſſels of glory of than thou art? yet the Lord hath paſſed them by, he hath paſſed by <hi>Eliab</hi> and <hi>Shammah,</hi> that were ſonnes of the ſame Father with thee, and hath choſen thee that wert the leaſt of all, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> that were thy elder brethren, and hath choſen thee. 2. <hi>Thee,</hi> that wert as low as others. <hi>Adam</hi> left thee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93551:87"/> as deep in hell as any reprobate there. Loe here, the infiniteneſſe of free grace! Two were in the ſame houſe, yea grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the ſame mill of iniquity, and thou art taken, and the other is left; poſſibly thou wert in thy wildeſt youth, ſeeming to ride faſter to hell than the other were that were thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, friends and acquaintance, yet the Lord hath raiſed <hi>thee,</hi> and let the others lye wallowing in their bloud, he hath not ſaid to them, <hi>live.</hi> 3. <hi>Thee,</hi> that wert his Enemy. Was ever dying love, yea love in dying extended to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before? You have heard of two ſtories, one of a Grecian, the other of a Roman paire; <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Perithous, Pilades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> that would have dyed for their friends, each for another, but hath any offered to dye for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? <hi>Moſes</hi> would offer to have his name blotted out for his people, that were Gods people, and which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but would <hi>Moſes</hi> have done it for a Philiſtine? yet this hath Chriſt done. <hi>O love ye the Lord all his Saints!</hi> 4. <hi>Thee that never askt it.</hi> He was found of them that ſought it not. Alas,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93551:87"/> mankind lay as well without a tongue to aske, as an hand to help themſelves, and behold, Chriſt pitied them, and amongſt them thee; his love declared from Eternity towards thee, had not ſo much cauſe in thee as a poore prayer would have amounted to; he was not moved by thy ſighs and teares, but by his owne infinite love. 5. Laſtly, <hi>thee that haſt ſtill Rebellion in thee.</hi> Chriſt ſaid within himſelfe, when he dyed upon the Croſſe, Now is my heart-bloud powred out for as vile wretches as any are, and for thoſe that I know will requite my bleeding wounds, my dying love, with new ſpeares and thornes; thus he knew that thou wouldſt doe in the time of thy unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracie, yea and after thou ſhouldſt be called too: <hi>Who lives, and ſinnes not?</hi> Now Chriſtian, lay theſe things to thy heart, meditate of, ſtudy out this love, and ſee if thou haſt not cauſe to ſay, <hi>My ſoule and all that is within me,</hi> my tongue and all that is without me, <hi>praiſe the Lord.</hi> But, O remember! Chriſtian, Remember! <hi>Burnt offering and ſacrifice</hi> he doth not require, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93551:88"/> this he requires, that thou ſhouldſt doe his will. O ſay, Loe I come: I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do it. But more particularly let me point thee out ſome particular duties, that the Lord requires of thee, in a poor anſwer to his rich Acts of eternall love.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hath not he thought his glory too deare to lay aſide for a while for thee, nor his Word and Truth too dear to pawne for thee, nor his bloud too deare to ſpill for thee? hath he valued nothing in compariſon of thee? <hi>O doe thou value nothing in an equall ballance with him;</hi> be willing to deny thy ſelfe for him, who in every thing hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed himſelfe for thee. Thy Luſts cannot be ſo pleaſing to thee, as Chriſts glory was to him; Be content to leave them. Thy Honour cannot be ſo great as his was, which he left for thee, and became ignoble in our eyes. <hi>Surely when wee ſaw him, we eſteemed him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, ſmitten of God, and afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 53. 4. But it was when <hi>hee was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our Tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities, when the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him,</hi> and that <hi>by his ſtripes we might be healed.</hi> Thy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93551:88"/> Riches cannot be greater than his; yet remember him, O remember the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who though he was rich, yet for your ſake became poore, that you through his Povertie might be made rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Thy life cannot be more deare than his; yet he valued not his life for thee, but powred out his bloud, his precious bloud, upon the Croſſe, that through his bloud thou mighteſt have remiſſion purchaſed. Learne hence Chriſtian a leſſon of <hi>ſelf-deniall:</hi> Be content to ſuffer for him, who was content to ſuffer that he might raiſe thee; value nothing in compariſon of him. This Leſſon had Saint <hi>Paul</hi> learned, Phil. 3. v. 7, 8. <hi>What things were gaine to me I counted loſſe for Chriſt, yea doubtleſſe and I count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and doe count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, being made conformable unto his death.</hi> Looke upon nothing in an
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93551:89"/> equall ballance with him, 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing amongſt you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, hath Chriſt entred into a Covenant, and given his word to his Father, and kept his word with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for you? O then, learne of him: <hi>Vow your ſelves to him, and keep the vowes of your lips.</hi> Say with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116. ver. 16. <hi>Ah Lord! truly we are thy ſervants, we are thy ſervants, and the ſons of thy handmaids, for thou haſt looſed our bonds.</hi> Say with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 40. <hi>Mine eares haſt thou opened,</hi> and bored <hi>them.</hi> Say, Ah Lord, we come to doe thy will. Chriſt kept his word with his Father for you, Ah, keep your word with him, pay him the vowes which you have made.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hath Chriſt to raiſe you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him your fleſh? O then, <hi>Take ye upon your ſelves his ſpirit:</hi> He hath become for you the childe of man, doe you become for him the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; <hi>Be made partakers of the divine Nature, having eſcaped the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the world through</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93551:89"/> 
                     <hi>luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. Your Nature was full of imperfection and weakneſſe, the divine Nature is full of perfection and glory: He hath raiſed you, be raiſed, put off your filthy rags, and put on change of Raiment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hath Chriſt died that he might raiſe you from the death of Sinne, and from the power of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death? O then, <hi>dye to ſinne,</hi> Col. 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate affection, evill concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe, which is idolatry, for which things, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth the great duty of mortification from this very principle, <hi>Likewiſe reckon yee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo your ſelves to be dead to ſinne, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6. 11. and ſo on, ver. 12, 13. <hi>Let not ſinne therefore reigne in your mortall bodies, &amp;c.</hi> Ah, throw away the nailes that pierced your Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Did Chriſt riſe from the dead, that he might raiſe you from the death of ſinne? <hi>O then riſe to newneſſe of life.</hi> The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93551:90"/> this worke of Vivification alſo, from Chriſts Reſurrection, Rom. 6. ver. 4. <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſme into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen ſo, we alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life;</hi> and ſo all along that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Hath he aſcended that he might raiſe us? O then let us likewiſe aſcend after him, ſetting our affections <hi>upon things which are above, not upon things which are below.</hi> Chriſt who is our treaſure is aſcended: Let our hearts alſo be where our treaſure is, Col. 3. ver. 1. <hi>If then ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7.

No, no, be aſſured, as Heaven is purchaſed for thee, ſo it ſhall be given to thee. Chriſt uſeth not to doe his worke by the halves. <hi>I have not loſt one of them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) he knowes them by name, they cannot be miſſing, his worke ſhall not be in vaine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one of his choſen ones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let Chriſtians from hence be <hi>comforted concerning others.</hi> 1. Such of their friends as they may ſadly feare, have as yet no portion in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. O pray for them, weep for them, ſpeake to them in the name of the Lord, and yet hope, that though they be not actually raiſed, yet they may be meritoriouſly raiſed: There is many a one that hath a white name in Gods Election-booke, and whoſe name Chriſt hath engraven upon his hands, that to us is yet a black child of wrath, a ſtranger to the Covenant of Grace. If their names be there, Chriſt will in his owne time raiſe him betwixt this and the Judgment day; there is a ſpare
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93551:92"/> roome in Heaven for them. 2. Art thou diſconſolate to ſee ſome of thy friends in great terrors, in great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſpirit? O rejoyce over them Chriſtian, it is probable Chriſt is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. Be aſſured, if they be his, he will raiſe them, there is not the loweſt worme that belongs to Chriſt, but he hath provided an high place for them; Not the moſt blubber'd-eyed, uncomely Chriſtian (in thine eyes) in the world, but Jeſus Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided an handkerchiefe to wipe all teares from their eyes; Chriſt hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and will raiſe them.</p>
                  <p>One Branch of my uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I forgate in its due place, take it now in a word.</p>
                  <p>We may hence be inſtructed, and let us learne, <hi>how much Chriſt deſerves our cleaving to him in the wilderneſſe, in all trials, and croſſes whatſoever.</hi> I take this to be the proper uſe of this Text. The Spouſe had fancied to her ſelfe what the world would ſay of her, how they would admire her dependance upon Chriſt, when he ſeemed to leave her,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93551:92"/> and make her ſad; Chriſt replyes in the words of the Text, <hi>I raiſed thee up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apple-tree,</hi> &amp;c. As much as to ſay; And doe I not deſerve all this love, and a great deale more? Is it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that thou thus cleaveſt to me? Remember what thou wert by Nature; Remember who hath done all the good for thee that is done for thy ſoule.</p>

The Wilderneſſe is a <hi>ſolitary place;</hi> where hee that walks, as hee hath no path, ſo he hath no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: The paths in the Wilderneſſe are not trodden, no beaten high wayes are there; no company but the Owles and the Oſtriches, the beaſts of the field, and creeping things of the earth. Nothing fit to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for man: No, it is a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Wilderneſſe is a <hi>diſconſolate place;</hi> no curioſities of nature to refreſh his ſpirits with: Terror is round about him; no pleaſure to delight him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, the Wilderneſſe is a place <hi>voyd of all proviſions;</hi> There is neither bread for the hungry, nor water for the thirſty ſoule; no neceſſaries, much leſſe ſuperfluities.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93551:101"/>
                  <p> The expreſſion is very apt: ſuch a Wilderneſſe, yea many a ſuch Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Spouſe of Chriſt hath had, and may have, her dwelling in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Wilderneſſe of Sinne. 2. A Wilderneſſe of Sorrow. 3. A Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of Affliction. 4. A Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Temptation. 5. A Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Deſertion. Nay, laſtly, This whole life is but a wilderneſſe to her. Shee hath been in ſome of theſe, and may be in all of them; but out of all Shee cometh up leaning. Every one of theſe is the ſoules Wilderneſſe: and as they come up to Chriſt, they come up from ſome of them; and in their walking with the Lord Chriſt, they goe through ſome of them; and ſome goe through all of them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Eremus peccati,</hi> The Wilderneſſe of ſinne; and every ſoule is born in this Wilderneſſe. Man at firſt created dwelt in Paradiſe; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, he threw himſelfe out into the Wilderneſſe, and God lockt the Garden gate againſt him. Sinfull man perferr'd the Wilderneſſe before Paradiſe, and God allots him his dwelling there:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93551:102"/> There was man thrown, &amp; all mankind born in it. We are all Wilderneſſe brats by nature, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>You were children of wrath by nature, even as others.</hi> And ſinne may well be call'd a Wilderneſſe; it is <hi>ſtatus naturalis,</hi> our naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: We are in a Wilderneſſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, when we are clothed with the raggs of iniquity. Ay and it is a ſtate as dangerous as the Wilderneſſe: The Lion claims him in the Wilderneſſe as his prey; and if he ſcapes his teeth, it will be hard to eſcape the Cockatrice, and young Lion, and Adder, the leſſer fry of deſtroyers: If in this ſinfull natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition we do eſcape the mouth of the <hi>roaring Lion</hi> the <hi>Devill,</hi> it is greatly to be feared that the Beare, and the Wolfe, and the Cockatrice, the leſſer judgments of God, will ſwallow us up: we are children of wrath, as well paſſively as actively, in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition. Laſtly, as the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a place void of all neceſſary proviſions for the body, ſo is ſinne a ſtate voyd of all neceſſary proviſions for the ſoule: We are hungry, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and bloudy, and filthy in our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93551:102"/> ſinnes, it is a wilderneſſe dreſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>As for thy nativity, in the day that thou wert born, thy navell was not cut: neither wert thou waſhed in water to ſupple thee, thou wert caſt out in the open field,</hi> Verſe. 5. Every ſpouſe of the Lord Chriſt hath been in this Wilderneſſe. <hi>Who is this that cometh up?</hi> of this I have ſpoke before, and therefore paſſe it over.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Wilderneſſe is <hi>Eremus contritionis,</hi> The wilderneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or ſorrow for ſinne. Every ſoul is naturally in the Wilderneſſe; but every one that is in it ſeeth not that it is there: Every ſoul is born blind, though moſt think they ſee. When God opens the ſoules eyes, and ſhewes it the hell that it treads over every houre, and makes the ſoule apprehenſive of its danger, it conceives it ſelfe in a worſe Wilderneſſe than before; the phyſick works, the Patient thinks it is nearer death than before it took it. Here it cryes out, Oh, I am a loſt undone crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Oh, whither ſhould I goe? on one ſide behold terror! on the other ſide deſpaire! If it lookes up to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93551:103"/> heaven, there is an angry God; if downward, there is a gaping hell: Oh! whither ſhould it goe? Now it cryes out (with the Iaylor) O <hi>what ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> I am loſt in my ſinnes! I am loſt in my owne righteouſneſſe! I know not what to doe: If I ſtay in my ſinnes I periſh; if I go out of the world I periſh. Here ſtands the ſoule turning it ſelfe every way, and ſeeing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort no way, till the Lord Chriſt bowes the heavens, and thruſts out his arme of ſalvation, his ſhoulder of merits, and takes the ſoule by the hand, ſaying, Come (my Beloved) I will tell thee what thou ſhalt doe; I am the way out of this wilderneſſe, come out <hi>leaning;</hi> leane thy arme of faith upon the ſhoulder of my merits; Free grace is able to beare thee: I am thy Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved, and <hi>thy Welbeloved is thine.</hi> And ordinarily the ſoule when it comes to the Lord Chriſt, comes through this wilderneſſe, this loſing place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and contrition, and weeps her ſelfe a path, where ſhe would drown in the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> if Chriſt did not hold her up. Indeed God could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93551:103"/> have brought the Iſraelites a ſhorter, Journey, than through the wilderneſſe to Canaan; and ſometimes God mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly drawes a ſoul to himſelfe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the cords of mercy: God is not tyed alwayes to bring a ſoule the ſame road to heaven; <hi>Elijah</hi> was carried to heaven in a fiery chariot; but the more ordinary way is by <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder. The common way to heaven is by the gates of hell; the way to life is through the chambers of death, through a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Who is this that commeth up out of the wilderneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Wilderneſſe in which Chriſt's Spouſe may ſomtimes have her dwelling in, is the <hi>Wilderneſſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> bodily afflictions I meane. A Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe is a place full of bryars and thornes; and through ſuch a wilderneſſe (the holy Ghoſt tells us) lies the Saints way to heaven: <hi>By much tribulation</hi> [much pricking of thrones, thornes in the fleſh ſomtimes] <hi>muſt we enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> The Spouſe hath a dirty way to go to marrying in; and when ſhee is marryed, ſhe hath a dirty way home too: A wilderneſſe on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93551:104"/> ſide. The Apoſtle ſpeakes plain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37, 38. <hi>They wandred about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skines, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, afflicted, tormented, they wandred in deſerts, and in mountaines, and in dens, and in caves of the earth;</hi> And who were theſe that wandred thus in the wilderneſſe? They were ſuch <hi>of whom the world was not worthy;</hi> the Spouſes of the Lord Chriſt. And truely afflictions may be called a wilderneſſe, for the diſconſolacy of them too; they are times of ſorrow, no delights pleaſe; the ſpouſe in affliction is in a wildernes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth wilderneſſe that the Spouſe ſometimes dwells in, is the <hi>wilderneſſe of temptations,</hi> The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom himſelf was in this wilderneſſe; <hi>He was led into the wilderneſſe, to be tempted of the Devill;</hi> The ſpirit took him thither, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>Paul</hi> was in this wilderneſſe, troubled on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide; this is Satans wilderneſſe, that he leads many a poore ſoule into, and it had been a ſad wilderneſſe, had not our WAY been their firſt: If the Devill could have loſt our Saviour in it, we ſhould never have found the way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93551:104"/> out of it. A dangerous, a diſconſolate place, well tearmed a wilderneſſe, as the Saint will tell you that hath been in it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth Wilderneſſe that the Spouſe is ſometimes in, is the <hi>Wilderneſſe of deſertion.</hi> Heres a ſad wilderneſſe, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert indeed, <hi>Quum Dens deſeruit,</hi> When God hath forſaken or withdrawne himſelfe from the Soule; this Deſert Chriſt himſelfe was in, <hi>Eli, Eli, lama-ſabachthani? My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> was the voice of the Lord Jeſus hollowing in the wilderneſſe: ſuch a wilderneſſe was the Spouſe in, when ſhe <hi>ſought him, but found him not,</hi> Cant. 3. v. 2. In this deſert the ſoule is ſolitary, her God is gone, and ſhe knowes not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him; the ſoule never calls any company her company, if her God be not there. <hi>David</hi> was in this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe too, he is often crying out of the wilderneſſe he was in, when God hid his face from him. The foule that belongs to the Lord Jeſus goes through many a wilderneſſe in this world, but ſcarce any which Chriſt hath not walkt in before it, and hewn a way through it;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93551:105"/> through every wilderneſſe we may follow the Lamb in his own path.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nay laſtly, The Saints whole life below, is but a wildernes. Earth is a Chriſtians deſert; while ſhe lives here, ſhe lives in widowhood; it is a ſinfull place, a dangerous place, a thorny place, and a place where ſhe finds an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the joyes ſhe ſhall be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in in glory. Mortality is but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhech,</hi> and her beſt habitations are but <hi>tents of Kedar,</hi> nothing to the temple of Glory ſhe ſhall worſhip her God in hereafter; and the former deſerts are but as ſeverall corners of this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but ſhe commeth up out of every wilderneſſe: That is the next branch of Doctrine I haſten to.</p>
                  <p>Branch 2. <hi>That though the Saint of God hath had, and may have, her dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſſe, ſhe reſts not there, but commeth up out of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She cometh up. It ſeemes to argue a propriety in the motion, as if ſhe were not driven nor drawne up, nor made to come, but of her ſelfe came, and of her owne ſtrength, and yet not of her own ſtrength neither; her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93551:105"/> owne leggs would not beare her, for the text tells us ſhe comes up leaning, ſhe had fallen had ſhe not leaned.</p>
                  <p>Here is the Queſtion ſtated; what the ſoule doth towards its converſion, what power of doing any thing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards its converſion before it is ſanctified, or after it is ſanctified, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may meerly paſſive, what ſhe may doe, what ſhe cannot doe, how far ſhe may come, where ſhe muſt lean?</p>
                  <p>Whether hath the ſoule any power to come up out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne to the Lord Chriſt, to move one ſtep heaven ward of it ſelfe? And here I have a narrow path to tread betwixt the Pelagians and Arminians on the one ſide, that would make the ſoule have more power than it hath: and the Antinomians and Sectaries on the other ſide, that are ſo farre from holding that the ſoule hath no power to come to Chriſt, that they would make us beleeve ſhe hath no power to come to Church neither.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not know how to determine this Queſtion better than in the words of pious and learned Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93551:106"/> Determ. <hi>Q.</hi> 9. 49. <hi>Non poteſt quodvis opus ex divina premiſſione, ad impetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam peecatorum remiſſionem, aut adeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam poſſeſſionem regni coelorum ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> The ſoule cannot doe any thing that is ordained by God, or hath the promiſe of God, to obtaine pardon of ſinnes, or poſſeſſion of the Kingdome of heaven; ſhe cannot ſavingly beleeve, repent, love, &amp;c. for theſe are the acts of grace, and God is the fountain and donour of all grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But firſt, ſhe may, by Gods gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſtraining grace, without ſpeciall and ſaving grace, abſtaine from groſſe ſinnes; the heathens did ſo; the light of nature which God keeps from none, will ſhew her that this is darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, She may by Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing grace, without any ſaving grace, performe many previous actions that are required of men to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſhe may by vertue of Gods ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grace, his exciting grace, goe to Church, hear the word of God, meditate of God, <hi>peccat a propria conſider are &amp; se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu eorum expaveſcere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Davenant;</hi> Ay, and ſhe may beg deliverance from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93551:106"/> that wofull condition, which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends her ſelfe in; but ſhe ſtirrs not one of theſe ſtepps after a ſpirituall, but after a naturall manner, till the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace of God come: A man may in a wilderneſſe conceive himſelfe loſt, look about for the way out, call for help, be willing to be out, yet not be one ſtep in the way that will lead him out; and this the ſoule muſt doe ſo farr as it can: <hi>Negamus etenim hanc gratiam regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem infundi hominibus inertibus, ſed animis per verbum Dei erectis, &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act is, &amp; per praedictas actiones quodam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo diſpoſitis, viz.</hi> We deny that rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating grace is infuſed into ſloathfull men, but into ſoules ſubdued by Gods word and law, and after a manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the foregoing actions; yet we ſay, that even theſe foregoing actions have their firſt motions from God; and the queſtion is whether God doth not firſt work a ſight and ſenſe of ſinne, and an humiliation for it by his exciting grace, before he comes with his rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating, quickning and ſaving grace into the ſoule; we ſay he doth in his ordinary courſe of his diſpenſations,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93551:107"/> Only I muſt bee here ſafely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that I ſpeak according to mans apprehenſion; for in reſpect of God, nothing is firſt or laſt, he works all in an inſtant, all graces together in the ſoule; but the queſtion lies not <hi>whether God works the habit of Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the habit of Faith,</hi> or no; for without queſtion he works together all his works; but whether God makes humiliation act before faith, which we ſay he doth; <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> may be in their mothers womb together, but <hi>Eſau</hi> may come out and be ſeen in the world before <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet not tying up the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to this method, who can and will work any way, even which way it pleaſeth him. Nor doe we ſay any ſuch previous action can be performed by the Creature, <hi>ut de merito congrui teneatur Gratiam dare,</hi> That God is bound for the deſert of any ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous action to give his inward and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating quickning grace; But yet this <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dave.</hi> ibid.</note> we ſay, that in the Church of God, where men are dayly ſtirr'd up by the word and ſpirit to repent and beleeve ſavingly, God will give (though not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93551:107"/> for any of theſe previous or diſpoſitory actions, yet) freely, regenerating grace to all ſuch as are capable of it, unleſſe they have reſiſted the ſpirit of God in the preceding operations, and rejected his quickning grace; but yet we deny, that any man can performe theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo but he will offend and reſiſt the Spirit of God in them: Now why, when as all reſiſt, God ſhould reject ſome, as they have rejected him, and leave them to the hardneſſe of their own hearts, and work irreſiſtibly on others who have reſiſted their God as much, and break open their hearts, though lock'd and barr'd againſt him, and fill them with quickning grace, and pull a <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom</hi> by force, and draw a ſoule out of the wilderneſſe by head and ſhoulders, I ſay, why he ſhould doe it, when two are grinding at the ſame mill, take one and leave the other; when two are in the ſame field, why the one ſhould be taken the other left; when two ſoules are equall in duties, faſting, mourning, in the way that God hath appointed, why he ſhould baulke this and take the other,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93551:108"/> when perhaps that which is taken hath been the leaſt penitent too, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> is <hi>Sacrum Miſterium divinae voluntati reliquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> A ſacred and ſecret miſtery to be left to the divine pleaſure, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lies in the agents own breaſt; It is becauſe <hi>he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy, and whom he wills he hardeneth:</hi> God is his owne reaſon, and his free grace its owne cauſe.</p>
                  <p>So then we conclude, that the ſoule cannot move one foot to a ſpirituall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpiritually, not by any common grace, it muſt be only by Gods regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and ſaving grace. So that to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer yet more diſtinctly to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In reſpect of Gods exciting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace, if we looke ſo farre, we cannot come, but that preventeth us: We are as clay in the hands of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we are all dead in ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But when the Lord hath changed the ſoule, then it commeth. The firſt motion upon the will is from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is any motion of the will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; but when the will is healed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93551:108"/> of God, then the ſoule commeth, then the ſoule which was meerly paſſive before, is active, and will endeavour to doe ſomthing for that God that hath done ſo much for her. It followes, the drawing of Gods moſt holy Spirit: <hi>Draw me</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>and I will run after thee,</hi> Firſt, I muſt be drawne; but then I will run: In the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God makes us to will, and we will; &amp; yet all the efficacy of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes from Gods moſt holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>It is certaine (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> that <note place="margin">Certum eſt nos velle quum volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed ille facit ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus qui operatur in nobis velle.</note> wee are willing when wee are willing, but he makes us willing, that workes in us to will and to perform, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. And ſo he, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God drawes, but he drawes the ſoule that is willing; Ay, but firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he makes it willing. So, I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what proprietie the ſoul hath in the Action, how ſhe commeth, and how willing ſhe is to the motion. She is drawne, but ſhe is willing to be drawne to Jeſus Chriſt. But firſt, ſhe is made willing before ſhe is willing, ay, and in her life, after ſhe is come to Chriſt, in her walking with Chriſt, <hi>Non ſuis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidit viribus,</hi> ſhe truſts not her owne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93551:109"/> ſtrength, ſhe even then commeth <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is the next Branch of the Doctrine I have to handle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though ſhe comes up from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, ſhe comes up, not of her owne ſtrength, but leaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us enquire what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion holds out to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is the ſoules hand.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Who is it ſhe leanes upon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What in him ſhe hath to truſt to, and how in every wilderneſſe ſhe leans, and out of every wilderneſſe comes up leaning.</p>
                  <p>I conceive, here are foure things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this expreſſion <hi>leaning,</hi> which I may tearme the foure fingers of the Spouſes hand, which ſhe layes upon her Saviours ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It doth argue that the ſoule is weary, otherwiſe ſhe would not leane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a willing poſture;</hi> I am not forced to leane, I do it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: The ſoule that comes up with Chriſt is willing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is a poſture of love;</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe would not leane.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It doth argue a confidence that the ſoule hath in the Lord, that he</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93551:109"/> 
                     <hi>is able to beare her;</hi> Otherwiſe ſhee would not truſt the weight of her ſoule upon him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it doth argue <hi>wearineſſe;</hi> If ſhe were not weary ſhe would not leane. Humiliation is a preface to faith, and the way to be found is to be loſt. It is not a leaning of wantonneſſe, but a lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wearineſſe. O Lord, I am ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, let me ſave my ſelfe from ſinking by thy ſhoulders; I am falling, Lord let me leane; whiles the ſoule hath any ſtrength to goe, it is too proud to be beholden to leane; <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. Firſt, weary, then come: Firſt, heavy laden; then I will eaſe you: <hi>What ſhall I doe to be ſaved</hi> (ſaith the Gaolor?) O I am loſt! undone! I am at a Non-plus! O what ſhall I doe? I am weary! for I am farre readier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that that Voice, <hi>What ſhall I doe?</hi> is rather the Voice of the ſoul (at it's <hi>nil ultra)</hi> ſadly ſenſible of it's loſt and miſerable condition, ſufficiently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the ſenſe of it, than the voice of a ſoule, thinking it might <hi>doe</hi> any thing that might be but in the leaſt contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93551:110"/> to the deſert of ſalvation. I cannot be perſwaded, to think, that when the Gaolor ſpake thoſe words, proſtrated by humiliation at the Apoſtles feet, that he had the leaſt thought that he could throw in ſo much as <hi>two mites into the Treaſury</hi> of free grace. But as it is the ordinary ſpeech of one drown'd in the depth of ſorrow; O what ſhall I doe? What ſhall <hi>I</hi> doe? though at that inſtant they know they can doe nothing to help themſelves: So the Gaoler, in a true ſenſe of his owne loſt condition, cryes out, O <hi>what ſhall I doe?</hi> he was weary, it was time for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to bid him leane, then <hi>beleeve</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> It is but a wreſting of the place, or mocking it rather, to bring it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that duties preparatory were here excluded. Surely, had not the Apoſtles ſeen him humbled in ſome degrees, they would as well have prefixed <hi>Repent</hi> here, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and be baptized.</hi> Chriſt <hi>came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> He is a Saviour, but it is for them that are loſt in their owne feeling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93551:110"/> too. And the truth of it is, the ſoule ſcornes to leane upon Chriſt ſo long as it is able to goe alone, when it hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a crutch of merits or duties to reſt upon, then it lookes out for ſome reſt for it's foot, for ſome ſhoulder to beare up, for ſome ſtaffe to ſtay it ſelfe upon. Leaning doth argue wearineſſe, that's the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It doth argue a <hi>willingneſſe</hi> in the ſoule to come to Jeſus Chriſt; Leaning is not a forced action. Indeed (as I ſaid before) Chriſt firſt works this willingnes; he it is that gives us power to will, and it is by his power that we are willing, as it is written, <hi>They ſhall be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 110. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>willing in the day of my power;</hi> But he doth not let us leane before we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Leaning is an action proceeds from the will, <hi>Who is this cometh up leaning?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, leaning doth argue <hi>love;</hi> who leans upon his enemies? I will not leane upon one whom I cannot truſt, I muſt have ſome good thoughts of his love. The ſoul that leans upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt loves Chriſt, that Faith, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended dependancy of any upon Chriſt, that proceedeth not out of a principle
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93551:111"/> of love, groweth out of a falſe root; the loving ſoule is only the truly beleeving ſoule. <hi>Leaning is a loving poſture,</hi> that is the third.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It doth argue <hi>fiduciam,</hi> a reſting, a truſting the ſoule upon Chriſt; he that leans upon another repoſeth his whole weight, truſteth his whole ſtrength upon him: He doth as much as ſay, well, I know I cannot goe alone, I cannot ſtand; but I will truſt my ſelf, upon thy ſtrength will I leane, if I fall, I fall: So the ſoule that comes up out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth repoſe it's whole weight upon the Lord Chriſt, it ſayes, O Lord, I am a great and grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I am not able to ſtand upon mine owne legges, but I truſt my ſoule upon thy armes; thou haſt mercies, and great mercies, and free mercies, if I fall, I fall; if be damned, I am damned; here I will leane. And here you have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing plaine, <hi>viz,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſoules hand with which ſhe leanes upon Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation,</hi> and theſe 4. things which I have hinted from this expreſſion, <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93551:111"/> are as the foure fingers of the hand of Faith. And we may thus give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith is the hand of a ſoule which God hath humbled, whereby the ſoule being not able to ſtand alone, nor daring to truſt to any thing elſe, and being made willing by God, out of a principle of love, layes hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, and truſts, and reſts it ſelfe upon him for her ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And that leads me to the third thing I propounded, the Perſon upon whom ſhe leanes, the text renders it, <hi>Her beloved;</hi> or as I conceive, the old Tranſlation better, <hi>Her welbeloved:</hi> The Latine <hi>dilectum ſuum,</hi> him that <hi>is her</hi> conjugally <hi>beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the laſt Branch of the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, <hi>That though the beleeving ſoule comes up from the wilderneſſe leaning, yet ſhe will onely leane upon her beloved, and he only can and will beare her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know, that whoſoever leanes, muſt have a perſon to leane upon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There muſt be a capacity in this arme to beare her, ſome ſtrength, yea, there had need to be a great deale to hold up the weight of a ſoule. Firſt, let
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93551:112"/> us enquire who the Perſon is, rendred in the Text <hi>dilectum, Her welbeloved;</hi> in plaine termes her Husband, one that hath more than an ordinary portion of her love.</p>
                  <p>Here are five things hinted in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is one whom ſhe loves.</hi> The word ſignifies a ſpeciall ſort of love; and every greater includes a leſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>One that ſhe is married to, he is welbeloved,</hi> her deareſt love; not <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but <hi>dilectum;</hi> one that hath a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to her.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Her Beloved, not anothers Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Her Beloved, He that is her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, not who was her Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Her Beloved, not her Beloveds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is one whom ſhe loves.</hi> This I hinted at before; it is a principle of love that drawes the Soule to leane upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The hatred of her ſelfe, hath bred the love of her Saviour in it. And no Soul loves Chriſt more than that wich loaths it ſelf moſt. When the ſoule ſhall conſider what a Brand for Hell it was in its originall, how worthleſſe a worme it is, how
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93551:112"/> baſely it hath dealt by God, trampling upon his rich offers of Grace, ſcorning his Invitations. And again conſider, that God hath no need at all of it; But if it were burning in hell, could be as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as in its Salvation, and yet would be pleaſed to powre out his precious bloud for it, yet ſo unworthy: To wooe the Soule that hath need of him, and yet never praies to him, nor ever was a ſutor for mercy; This breeds love in the Soule: And the more the Soule fadomes her owne miſery, the more yet ſhe loves and admires the Lords mercy, and loving thus, ſhe leanes upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is one that ſhe pleades ſome title to, and intereſt in, ſhe cals him hers. Chriſt is the Bridegroome of the Soule, and the Soule is Chriſts Bride.</hi> Beloved, in all this Song is taken for the higheſt degree of love, and neareſt relation, conjugall love; therefore Chriſt elſewhere calls her his <hi>Siſter,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> ſhe hath a title to, and intereſt in him, poſſeſſion of him; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I am my welbeloved<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and <hi>my welbeloved is mine.</hi> She is his, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93551:113"/> he is hers: they have a propriety each in other. But ſuppoſe we ſhould put the Spouſe to prove her title to him, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than anothers Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?</hi> Or, why is he thy Beloved (O beleeving ſoule) more than the Beloved of another? ſhew thy title to him: And againe, why is ſhe Chriſts more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? Why ſhould the beleever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize Chriſt? and how came Chriſt to be hers? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſhe is his, and he is hers <hi>by right of gift, her heavenly Father hath given her unto him;</hi> hence is that Phraſe of her Saviours Prayer, <hi>John.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>All that the Father hath given me,</hi> and <hi>I pray for them that thou haſt given me. She hath given her ſelfe to him,</hi> Cant. 1. 2. <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better than wine.</hi> She hath ſaid, <hi>Draw me, and I will run after thee;</hi> ay, and <hi>he hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to her;</hi> he hath given his <hi>grace</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. And his <hi>glory</hi> unto her. <hi>The glory which thou haſt give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. Her Beloved</hi> by right of gift. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. She is his, and he is hers, <hi>by right of bargaine and ſale.</hi> The Ancients had three waies to get themſelves wives;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93551:113"/> by gift, purchaſe, or deſert. The Fathers ſold their Daughters, and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome bought his Bride, he gave a Dowry for her. Hence when <hi>Sechem</hi> had a mind to <hi>Dinah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>Aske me what Dowry thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</hi> Chriſt hath bought his Beloved; hence (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>He hath paid a price for us.</hi> A bloudy price: more than all the world was worth. But he would have her becauſe he delighted in her, and ſo ſhe is his, and he is hers, <hi>by right of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. She is his Beloved, and he is hers, <hi>by right of deſert,</hi> ſhe deſerved not him, but he deſerved her. This was a third way by which the Ancients got them wives, by ſome gallant explcit, or great ſervice. Their wives were ſomtimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for wages; <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved 14 years for <hi>Rachell, Gen.</hi> 29. 17. <hi>David</hi> for his Soveraignes daughter, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred great <hi>Goliah;</hi> and afterwards rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Philiſtines of their foreskins: he paid more for her, than ſhe proved to be worth. By this right, the beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule is the beloved of Chriſt, he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93551:114"/> hath ſerved a long ſervice for her; not fourteene, but above thirty yeares, he hath vanquiſhed the <hi>Goliahs</hi> of our ſoules, and hath conquered our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is hers, and ſhe is his, <hi>by right of poſſeſſion,</hi> he dwels in her, and ſhe dwels in him. The ſecond perſon in the Trinity is an inmate with the beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule, He dwels under the roofe of her heart, He hath a chamber in the ſoule, and hath pitched his tent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her, and ſhe is in him too, united each unto other, this is very plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live, but yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> I am the Carcaſſe, Chriſt the Soule; the ſoule moveth the body, ſo Chriſt moves my ſoule; I move not from any principle in my ſelfe, but from a principle of Grace. <hi>The life I live in the fleſh, I live by the life of the Sonne of God who dwelleth in me, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for me.</hi> Thus you ſee ſhe may well call Chriſt her Beloved, and Chriſt may well call her his Beloved, He hath a propriety in her, and ſhee hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in him alſo; hee hath marryed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93551:114"/> her, and dwels with her, yea, and in her, <hi>dilectum ſuum,</hi> her <hi>wellbeloved</hi> indeed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is <hi>her beloved, not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beloved.</hi> Every ſoule hath a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;</hi> the Drunkard hath his beloved cups; the wanton hath his beloved Queanes; the Covetous perſon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved gold; The ſoule that leanes upon Chriſt, goes not a whoring after other Gods. The Spouſe of Chriſt leanes not upon the Papiſts beloved merits, nor upon the <hi>Turks</hi> beloved <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> nor upon the Phariſees beloved duties, nor upon the Idolaters beloved Saints; ſhe ſayes, <hi>Abraham knowes her not, and Iſrael is ignorant of her, but</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord is her Father,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> and her Maker, her Redeemer, is her Husband, <hi>Creator tuus eſt ſponſus tuus.</hi> Her beloved, not anothers Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He that is her Beloved, not that which was her Beloved.</hi> She once loved her ſins, and her luſts were the beloveds of her ſoul. The name of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alim</hi> was in her mouth; her luſts were her Lords, and they ruled over her. But
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93551:115"/> now the name of <hi>Baalim</hi> is taken out of her mouth: ſhe calls the Lord <hi>Iſhi,</hi> God alone is <hi>her beloved.</hi> Sin was the dearly beloved of her ſoule, but now ſhee calls ſinne no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> ſhee calls it <hi>Marah;</hi> that which was once the ſweetneſſe, is now the bitterneſſe of her ſoule, ſhee takes no pleaſure in it; no, nor doth ſhe account her duties her beloved; ſhe uſeth them, but ſhee dares not truſt her ſoule upon them; ſhe dares not plead any deſert in them, though once perhaps ſhe had a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall conceit, that her duties would be her healing, yet when she comes to the Lord Chriſt to leane upon his Arme, though she uſeth duties, and is as full of Prayer and humiliation as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, shee knocks her hand upon her breaſt, and cryes <hi>ſhe is a ſinner.</hi> Oh, but what remedy? the knocking her hand upon her breaſt shee knowes cannot ſave her; no, for that, <hi>God be merciful to her,</hi> she leanes upon Chriſt, that is <hi>her now Beloved,</hi> not upon any duties, or any other merits that was before her Beloved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Her beloved, not her beloveds.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93551:115"/> The ſoule that comes to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt loves him intenſly, and as ſhe loves him beſt, ſo ſhe loves him onely. As nothing ſhall have her whole heart, ſo neither will ſhe divide her heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and another: he shall have her heart, and he onely shall have her heart, and he shall have her whole heart too; she dare truſt her ſtrength upon Chriſt, and upon him alone: she deſireth only to <hi>be found in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> who is her Bridegroome; shee is a Virgin, not a Whore; she leanes not upon Chriſt with one hand, and her owne Merits with another, no, nor dares shee leane upon the Merits of another; shee durſt not truſt the weight of her ſoule upon the wings of an Angel, nor to the Prayers of a Saint; she relies upon God, and upon God onely. The Papiſts leane upon Chriſt, but not upon him alone: shee knowes it wil be a dishonour both to her and her husband, to take any thing <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem amoris,</hi> to share with her husband in his love; shee will keep her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in being the wife of one Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93551:116"/>
                  <p> And ſo I have ſhewed you how ſhe leanes, what is her hand, who it is ſhe leanes upon, what title ſhe hath to him, what rules ſhe obſerveth in her lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I have but one thing more, and that is, to ſhew you what ſtrength there is in the Lord Chriſts ſhoulders to beare her; how ſhe leanes even in every wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and what fulneſſe of ſtrength there is in her husbands arme to keep her up from falling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt wilderneſſe you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was <hi>the wilderneſſe of ſinne:</hi> Here the Spouſe cannot be ſaid proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leane upon her beloved, for ſhe wants the hand of faith to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and indeed ſhe is not weary: yet I doe not know why in ſome ſenſe, even in this eſtate, the elect ſoule is not beholding to free grace; he is her Chriſt here, though he hath not yet manifeſted himſelfe to be her <hi>Jeſus,</hi> her Saviour. The elect ſoule in ſin is elect, and decreed to be ſaved, though ſhee be not declared to be elect; ſhe is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> in decree, though God hath not actually manifeſted his love unto her: he is not <hi>her beloved,</hi> but the ſoule is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93551:116"/> 
                     <hi>his beloved,</hi> not actually but decretally, he hath thoughts of good to her, but his thoughts are kept within himſelfe, till he is pleaſed to reveale them to her at his beſt time: ſhe is his beloved, though there be no correlation, ſhe is in his thoughts, his Spouſe, aye, and poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not conditionally. The <hi>Arminians</hi> falſely dreame of Gods conditionall decrees, becauſe they comprehend not the wayes of God: Beleeving is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required, yet it was not a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods decree: The ſoule is his beloved, though yet there be no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though ſhe be not his wife yet, yet she is intended for his wife. To ſpeake according to the wayes of men, I may intend to make a woman my wife, before I actually declare my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to her; she is my wife in my determinations and thoughts before I wooe her, though not actually my wife <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93551:117"/> the ſimile a little higher; A great Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour buyeth a woman that is a ſlave which he intends to marry, and will, whether ſhe will or no; yet he will wooe her, and if it be poſſible marry her <hi>will,</hi> as well as her <hi>perſon;</hi> yet whether ſhe will or no, he will and may marry her, for ſhe is his purchaſe, ſhe is his wife in his determination before he hath married her. But yet even this ſimile is lame. (Every ſimile, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wayes of God, with the wayes of man, muſt at leaſt halt of one foot) for though this Emperour hath power to force the womans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the action, yet hee hath no power to force her will, to be willing to the action, The will is alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, <hi>ſui juris;</hi> but God hath power, not only to marry the ſoule, which he hath bought from being a ſlave to the Devill, but to make her willing to marry him; yet ſhe is in Chriſts decree his Spouſe, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93551:117"/> be ſaid to be beholden unto the Lord Chriſt, and that thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Every ſoul hath the like principles of corruption, and would act to the full of it's depraved operations, were it not for Gods preventing and reſtraining grace, <hi>She is beholding unto God for his preventing and reſtraining grace,</hi> though here ſhe is meerly paſſive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, She is beholden unto God <hi>for his exciting grace.</hi> The ſoule heares, and faſts and prayes, meditates of her owne ſad condition though for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the action it is her owne, yet it is Gods exciting grace makes her willing to heare, faſt, pray, though not his ſpeciall ſaving-grace, yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace: But this is not the leaning meant in the Text ſhe leanes here upon Chriſt, but not upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> [a Saviour] upon God, but not as <hi>her Beloved.</hi> And here the ſoule is brought into a ſecond wilderneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The wilderneſſe of Sorrow, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Repentance,</hi> call it what you pleaſe, though I know the later tearme <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> be controverted by ſome.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93551:118"/>
                  <p> Yet I know not why we may not ſay, That a man may repent without ſaving-grace. And for that Repentance which they ſay muſt be the effect of faith, If I were a School-man, I ſhould rather call it Godly Sorrow, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to play upon tearmes: And for their defining Repentance, <hi>To be a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſinne out of the ſenſe of the love of God revealed in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is a definition they have deviſed for their owne purpoſe; And give them their premiſes according as they pleaſe, they would be poore Logicians if they made the concluſion to diſpleaſe them: For from hence they argue, If the love of God be the ground and cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>[viz.</hi> the love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and ſenſible to us, we having apprehended it by faith] the ſpeciall love of God, then faith muſt goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> an apprehenſion of Gods ſaving love, and reliance upon it. But I anſwer, the definition which they give us of Repentance is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; it is a definition of a <hi>Species</hi> in ſtead of a <hi>Genus</hi> (as we ſay in Logick) As ſome unwary Divines define Faith,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth wilderneſſe, in which the Spouſe of Chriſt leaneth upon her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and out of which ſhe commeth leaning, is <hi>the wilderneſſe of deſertion.</hi> And this is one of the ſaddeſt wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that the Spouſe of Chriſt comes in; and ſhe hath an hard work to leane here, when Chriſt ſeemeth to pull away his ſhoulder: yet even here ſhe leanes. Chriſt himſelfe did ſo: <hi>My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Mark the phraſe, Forſaken, yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken: the Bridegroome cryes out, he was forſaken, yet <hi>my God.</hi> Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking us is no ground for us to forſake him: If he ſeemes not to owne us, it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93551:127"/> is no warrant, nor policy in us not to owne him. It is the duty of a pious ſoule, when God clouds himſelfe, yet to cry, <hi>My God.</hi> The bowels of the father muſt yearne upon the childe againe, if the childe cryes, and will not ſhake him off. It is a remarkable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Though he kils me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> How now? if thou beeſt kill'd (bleſt <hi>Job)</hi> how canſt thou truſt? O immortall faith! that putteſt Spirits of confidence in the duſt and aſhes of <hi>Job.</hi> Let God hide himſelfe from the ſoule, and ſo kill it (For Gods ſeparation of himſelfe from the Chriſtians ſoule, is a worſe death than the ſeparation of his ſoule from his body) Yet the ſoule muſt truſt in him, it muſt, it will leane upon him. The Spouſe loſeth not, but quickens her faith in a fit of deſertion. That place of the Prophet is remarkable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Who is amongſt you that feareth the Lord? that obeyeth the voice of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? that walketh in darkneſſe and hath no light? let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> They that feare the Lord, though they may
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93551:127"/> walke in a darke wilderneſſe, and ſee no ſuch light as they were wont to ſee, have no ſuch comfortable enjoyments of their God as they were wont to have, yet they will truſt and reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Lord, and come out of this wilderneſſe <hi>leaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all the wilderneſſes of this life, the Spouſe will leane upon her Beloved, yea, and upon him alone, in all ſtates, in all conditions, upon him for directing grace, upon him for quickning grace, upon him for whatſoever ſhe hath need of, either pardon, or guidance, or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or aſſiſtance, or comfort, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; at all times ſhe muſt truſt <hi>in the covert of his wings,</hi> for all bleſſings. The Spouſe of Chriſt is a moſt dependent creature. The Babe of grace is never old enough to goe alone, it hangs like a childe upon the mothers hands, and leanes like a Bride upon the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groomes boſome.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I done with the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part, having ſhewed you, how ſhe hath had, and ſometimes hath her dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the wilderneſſe; and how out of every wilderneſſe ſhe commeth up,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93551:128"/> but leaning, and what ſtrength there is in her Saviour to beare her up <hi>leaning</hi> upon him, even in every wilderneſſe. <hi>Who is this commeth up from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe leaning upon her Beleved?</hi> Now let us ſee what uſe we may make of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt here may a word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and a brand of folly be faſtened upon divers erroneous opinions and practices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt is it ſo that the Spouſe of the Lord Chriſt, that comes, and is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Lord Chriſt, comes out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne? Then this may reprove the errour and folly of thoſe that dreame of heaven, and flatter themſelves with the hopes of glory, but yet never regard comming out of this wilderneſſe. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Theſe men dreame of Heaven, and yet never thinke of Repentance. Chriſt came to ſeeke and to ſave that which was loſt (friend) how loſt? what, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly loſt, as all of us were by Nature? This is an idle conſtruction that giddy headed Sectaries have of late deviſed to help themſelves to heaven with.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93551:128"/> The Devils are ſo loſt; yet Chriſt never came to ſave them. No no friend, it is thoſe that are loſt in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, thoſe that know not what to dot o be ſaved, thoſe that feel themſelves even in the jawes of hell: he makes apprehenſions of his wrath precede the apprehenſions of his love. But woe, and alas! how many thinke they have a part in Chriſt, That the Devill hath as great a part in Chriſt actually as they have? Heaven is growne the common journeyes end, and let men ride which way they liſt. Not the moſt debauched wretch in a Congregation, but aske him what he thinks ſhall become of him, if he dyes in that condition: why he hopes he ſhall goe to heaven; nay I wiſh he doth not ſay, he is ſure of it too. All men are ſinners: He is loſt, but Chriſt came <hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Tell him of mourning for his ſinnes, if he meanes to be comforted, of humbling himſelfe, if he meanes to bee exalted, of feeling hell, if ever he means to feele heaven: O then, you are a <hi>legall Preacher.</hi> Heare what the other ſide ſaith, what thoſe you call
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93551:129"/> Antinomian Preachers; O theſe are the only Goſpell-preachers to them. This makes them to paſſe for ſuch honeſt men: O they ſhew a fine Cuſhion-way to Heaven! that you ſhall not need wet a foot or eye in: But let them preach what they will (friend) beleeve him, who (although he knowes but little) yet knowes you muſt go out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe if ever you come there. The way is, neither the Drunkards Ale-way, nor the Adulterers uncleane way, nor the Covetous man his dirty way, nor the Ambitious mans high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>way, nor the Hypocrites hidden way, nor the Carnall-Goſpellers formall way, nor the Antinomians eaſie way. It is a way through a wilderneſſe, not a way in a wilderneſſe: The Spouſe is not deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by her ſtaying in the wilderneſſe, but by comming out of the wilderneſſe; <hi>Who is this commeth out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Doth the Spouſe of the Lord <hi>come out of a wilderneſſe</hi> of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>leaning upon her Beloved?</hi> Firſt, ſhe is in, then ſhe commeth out; then this reproves the folly of thoſe that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93551:129"/> preach men found before they were loſt, and of thoſe that dreame of <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> before they are in the wilderneſſe: The Spouſe <hi>leans,</hi> but it is when ſhe is comming out of the wilderneſſe: Is there any that preacheth down a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe of duties, that mockes at mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? that learne people a way to be found before they are loſt? Examine the Scriptures before you truſt them; under a pretence of exalting Faith, doe they not cry downe ſorrow for ſinne? and all other duties? Nay, they doe cry downe the preaching of the Law, to bring men to ſee they are in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, that they might leane: Doe they make you beleeve, that preaching the Law is a price of Anti-chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, and no one ought to preach it? And for their part, they will take heed of it, for feare of preaching away their hearers. O beware of this leaven! For my part, I cannot cloſe with this novell Doctrine, when I conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that this other way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath bin that which God hath moſt bleſt by his ſervants labours: Witneſſe our <hi>Rogers,</hi> our <hi>Hooker,</hi> our Pious <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard;</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:93551:130"/> thoſe <hi>three,</hi> to which many <hi>threes</hi> may be added, though they will ſcarſe come up to the firſt <hi>three.</hi> Thoſe three Conſtellations of Heaven, that have more light to darke Travellers, that wandred in the night of ſinne while they ſhined in our Firmament, then all theſe <hi>Ignes fatui;</hi> miſ-leading poore Travellers. Was ever any of theſe <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ſo honoured (though they have beat up the Drums almoſt in every ſtreet of the Kingdome for followers) as to gather ſuch Troopes of Saints to the Chriſtian warfare, as theſe before mentioned? Did ever God honour their labours ſo much as theſe? who (poor ſoules!) ſhone in their daies like lights under Buſhels too, had only the corner of a Pulpit, or a Pulpit in ſome blind corner tolerated them. Nay, looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe that have lately fallen into this Veine, and were Preachers of Gods whole truth before; was not their firſt fruits better, and more accepted of God then their harveſt is now? Hath not God diſtinguiſhed w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he will muſt honour, by making the firſt ripe grapes ſweeter then the whole
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93551:130"/> Vintage? were it onely for this, And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Saints of God, let them ſpeake their minds freely; hath not this beene the way of their converſion? Have not the beſt Saints in Heaven cryed out of the belly of Hell before God heard their voice? Was not <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrucken downe to the earth before he went in the Triumph of Glory? Did not the Gaolor come in <hi>trembling,</hi> and fall at the Apoſtles feet, and cry, <hi>what ſhall I doe to be ſaved;</hi> before they bid him <hi>beleeve, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Neither can they evade it with ſaying, That trembling was not an humiliation for ſinne, but occaſioned for feare his priſoners were gone. Leaſt people ſhould wreſt in that manner, The Holy Ghoſt hath cleared it to their hand; for before we read of his trembling, <hi>Paul</hi> had cryed <hi>with a loud voice,</hi> verſ. 28. <hi>Doe thy ſelfe no harme for we are all here.</hi> Neither doe wee read, that he trembled for that at all; but like one ſtruck ſenſeleſſe, and his ſpirits dead as it were, in a fit of deſperate madneſſe, was about with his Sword to let out his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93551:131"/> owne blood. Now I ſay, were it no more then to heare ſuch Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine which God hath chiefly honoured in his Servants lips, by making it efficacious for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſoules, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the experience of the generalitie of Gods Servants, if not contrary to the Preachers owne former and better thoughts and practice, it would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make me ſuſpend my faith, from being too haſtie to beleeve this new way to heaven: But it is enough to confirme me, to heare my Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Come unto me all yee that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> Before you are ſenſible of an heavy load you will need no eaſe, and to heare my Text ſpeaking of leaning, but in a wilderneſſe; Nay, it may be noted too, The Text ſaith, <hi>Who is this that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth?</hi> Not who is this that jumpeth up from the wildernes; I cannot fancy this going to Heaven at a running jump, nor can I like this preſſing faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching repentance alſo: <hi>Faith is an act of an humble ſoule.</hi> Nor can the ſoule apprehend the beautie of Chriſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93551:131"/> and love Chriſt, before it apprehends it's owne miſerable conditions. The onely harme this Doctrine doth, is to make poore ſoules preſume, inſtead of beleeving, for alas! Tell an impenitent ſoule of beleeving, it apprehends it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, becauſe it doth not underſtand it, and runnes upon a ſuppoſition, that it hath faith, when, alas, it beleeveth no more then the Devill beleeveth: ſorrow for ſinne is better underſtood by a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heart then faith is; for the truth of it is, the humble ſoule onely can tell what faith is: The other ſees, neither the want they have of faith, nor yet the nature of that precious grace. Shall I tell you what pious M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſayes concerning this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Faith (ſaith he) is bottomed upon the ſenſe and paine of a loſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Povertie is the neareſt capacitie of beleeving. This is Faiths method, be condemned, and be ſaved; be hang'd, and be pardoned; be ſick, and be healed. Faith is a flower of Chriſts onely planting, yet it growes out of no ſoile, but out of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and banke of the lake, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93551:132"/> burnes with fire and brimſtone<hi>—Antinomians</hi> (ſaith he againe) make faith an act of a lofty Phariſee, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>(immediato contactu)</hi> preſently, his hot boyling and ſmoking luſts to Chriſts wounds, blood, and merit, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſcience of a precedent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the perſon thus beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be humbled, wearied, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, grived for his ſinnes: I confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>This is haſtie, hot work, but it is a wanton, fleſhly, preſumptuous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it is an immediate work to lay hold on the promiſes and be ſaved.</hi>
                     </q> In his Book of the Tryal and Triumph of Faith, you hear the opinion of Gods Servants, and the Text mentions a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming too; <hi>pedetentim, gradatim,</hi> little by little, ſtep by ſtep: Thoſe that come, cannot goe ſo faſt as theſe, becauſe they are <hi>weary and heavy loadcn.</hi> Thoſe that learne people to jump, muſt take away <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. the heavy load of ſinnes which the Spouſe hath upon her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, keepes her from that haſtie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Antinomians</hi> make. I doe not ſpeake to limit the Almighties power, but to ſhew you his ordinarie diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93551:132"/> not what he can doe, but what he will doe, what he hath uſed to doe, and God ordinarily walkes in his owne paths, not in the paths our fancies make for him: we may looke for God in his ordinary wayes of Providence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of the ſoule; if he comes in a new way, it muſt be beyond our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; though not beyond our faith that he can doe it, yet beyond our faith that he will doe it. When wee have no word to aſſure us, what ſhall faith be builded upon? God can turne mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night into mid-day, <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> But we know in Gods ordinary courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, firſt comes the dawning of the day, then the morning, then the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: God can take a ſoule and marry it, and never humble it, but where hath he promiſed it? where hath he done it? or if he hath done it, wee ſay, one Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low makes not a Summer, one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple makes not a Rule, one preſident makes not a law. It is no rule for thee or me to truſt in that, no more then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the thiefe upon the Croſſe, might be a ſafe preſident for us to deferre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance till our dying day. Let thee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93551:133"/> and I learne to be humbled, to get bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts, to loath our ſelves, ſee our owne miſery. Sorrow is the ordinary doore to joy, Humiliation the ordinary ſtep to exaltation, Mourning for ſinne the onely preface to Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in Gods ordinary way of dealing out grace. The Latine is full, <hi>Quae eſt illa quae aſcendit,</hi> that <hi>aſcends</hi> from the wilderneſſe: Our Tranſlation <hi>commeth up,</hi> implying an aſcenſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tis her running up an hil. They that run up a mountaine, if they run too faſt, they may quickly run themſelves out of breath: it is bad jumpping over a broad ditch (eſpecially if it be drowning depth) for feare if wee jumpe ſhort we jumpe our laſt. It is a great jump from the bottome of Hell to Heaven, to take it at one leape. I wiſh, thoſe that dare take it, doe not fall ſhort and drowne themſelves eternally. I had rather goe up Gods ſteps, then make ſuch a haſty motion, God give me grace to aſcend up the Saints ſtaires to the chambers of glory. <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſuch a favourite to heaven, that God ſent a coach for him;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93551:133"/> But thoſe that will expect till that fiery Chariot be ſent downe for them too, I ſuppoſe may waite ſomething a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time then they deſire. O beg of God to humble you, to powre out his ſpirit of mourning, and ſupplications upon you, this will learne you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (friends) It is the humbled ſoule only that conſtrue that word <hi>Faith:</hi> it is Hebrew to others, it poſeth the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart, Faith is a riddle to them: Chriſt findes his Spouſe in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and there he gives her his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to leane upon: But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>She commeth up leaning out of the wilderneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it the duty of a ſoul that is in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of affliction, or temptation, or deſertion, to <hi>leane</hi> upon the Lord Chriſt? Then this may reprove thoſe that are in theſe wilderneſſes, and yet cannot be perſwaded to <hi>leane</hi> upon the Lord Chriſt: hence they cry out, O, faith is impoſſible! is it poſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Chriſt will ſave me? me, that have ſcorned his ſalvation, and ſlighted his mercies? And becauſe thou haſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93551:134"/> ſlighted mercy, wilt thou therefore ſtill ſlight mercy? ſtill refuſe his offer of grace? Thou ſinneſt as much now in not beleeving there is mercy for thee, that haſt diſpiſed mercy, as thou didſt ſinne in diſpiſing that mercy. O why is it harder to riſe up; then to caſt downe a ſoule? Why wilt thou not beleeve, O thou of little faith? Is the mole-hill of thy ſinnes, like the mountaine of his mercies? doth the voice of thy ſinnes roare like the voice of his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Is there any humbled ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord? O doe not provoke God by thy infidelity now he hath made thee capable of faith: You that are Chriſtians, for ſhame, in your ſeverall wilderneſſes of afflictions, temptations, and deſertions, doe not, O do not caſt downe your heads, and ſay, <hi>who ſhall ſhew us any good?</hi> or if you doe, ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the Saint in the enſuing words, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us:</hi> Beleeve in your depths of ſorrow, beleeve in your moſt trying afflictions, moſt ſadding temptations, moſt killing deſertions,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93551:134"/> beleeve me, it is the greateſt honour you can put upon the Lord Chriſt: And it is the greateſt diſhonour you can put upon your God, to have any diffidence in the Lords armes, any diſtruct in the Lords free grace. It is the property, nay, it is the duty of the Spouſe to come out of wilderneſſes leaning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Doth ſhe leane upon God before ſhee can come? muſt he worke the firſt motion to make her willing, before ſhe can beleeve in him?</p>
                  <p>Then how are thoſe to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that would make mans will to be the Author of its firſt motions unto God. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was a great defender of it.

Oh! How in theſe dayes are men tainted with theſe lazie.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93551:137"/> Chriſts ſtrength is perfected in our weakneſſe; we muſt underſtand if we be the children of God, that God hath therefore wrought in us, that we might alſo worke ſomething, and when we have wrought it, give thankes to God, who hath made us to worke; for God hath wrought in us, that we might worke, not that we ſhould be idle. Thus I have laboured to you to divide the Truth from Errour; Now you have heard of the leaven of theſe Phariſees; take heed of it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, what you have heard, that the ſoule that comes to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, leanes upon a new Beloved, not upon her old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, may ſerve to reprove thoſe that would faine plead a title to Chriſt and have a portion in Chriſt, but they will not take Chriſt alone: two ſorts there are of theſe; The one cannot leave their old beloveds, and the other cannot truſt this Beloved. O the wicked man would have his portion in Chriſt, if he might but have his luſts too, his pleaſures, his profit; but to take Chriſt, alone, O this is ſuch a hard ſaying that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93551:137"/> they cannot beare by any meanes; If Chriſt and his luſts would lye both in one bed, Chriſt at the feet, and his luſts at the head, then Chriſt ſhould be as welcome as any thing to him; but he is loath to ſue a divorce from this Beloved, he is loth to part with his old love for a new, till he ſeeth how he can love him; but at a venture he will take him <hi>in partem amoris.</hi> O wretch! flatter not thy ſelfe, if Chriſt be thy Beloved, he will endure no Polygamy; you muſt leave your ſinnes, or be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt. The true Spouſe leanes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her <hi>Beloved;</hi> not upon her <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds,</hi> upon her now <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes her old.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this may ſerve to reproove,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe that would leane upon Chriſt, but they dare not truſt their ſoules upon Chriſt alone. Forſooth he will be the Spouſe of Chriſt, but he muſt leane upon Chriſt with one hand, and his good works with the other. The whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under this laſh comes a better ranke of people, that when God hath
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93551:138"/> ſhewed them their owne ſinfull, ſad condition, they doe not only performe duties, pray, and mourne, and repent, and be humbled, all which they ought to doe, but they are ready to reſt in them, and make them their Beloved: It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to the ſoule, that God hath made to loath its ſinnes, to love its duties; it finds duties almoſt as conſentaneous to its nature, as ſinnes were before; and it is too ready to thinke that its ſaving, or damning, depends upon ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of teares, and humiliation: Hence, you heare ſoules in this condition, often complaining; Oh! I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, if I were humbled enough, if I could but mourne enough. This ſoule doth well to be ſenſible of the hardneſſe of its owne heart; and it is too true, it can never mourne, it can never be humbled enough. But it doth ill to think that free grace ſtints its operation, and bleſſed influence, to ſuch a quantity of teares, if it be humbled enough, to ſee its want of Chriſt. The water runs through the river, that is the way to the Sea, but it doth not reſt in the river, but with a ſwift and continued motion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93551:138"/> runs betwixt the banks, till it comes, and is ſwallowed up in the Sea: Even ſo the ſoul ought to run through duties, but not to reſt betwixt the banks of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to run through, till it come to the Sea of free grace, where it will be ſwallowed up of infinite mercy; and our imperfections will be drowned in his infinite perfection; we ought to take duties in our way to Chriſt, but not to make duties our <hi>Jeſus.</hi> God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that they ſhould fit us for him; but it is written, <hi>My glory will I not give to another.</hi> The glory of the Lords free grace, is his greateſt glory; he will not give that to any other: None ſhall ſhare with him in his Spouſes love, he is a jealous Saviour. The Spouſe leanes upon her <hi>Beloved,</hi> not Beloveds: Thus I have done with my uſe of reproofe.</p>
                  <p>The next uſe is for examination, here may every one try himſelfe whether he be the Spouſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or no: Even by what hath been already ſaid; I will reduce it all to three heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Examine thy ſelfe, <hi>whether thou beeſt out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne, yea, or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93551:139"/>
                  <p> Secondly, <hi>Whether thou wert, or art in any other wilderneſſe, yea, or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>What was, or is thy demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in theſe wilderneſſes thou haſt been, or art in, and how haſt thou come, or doſt thou come out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Examine whether thou beeſt not in the wilderneſſe of ſinne, yea, or no: It was given as the Character of the Spouſe, to come out of this wilderneſſe. O, but how ſhall I know that? (will the ſoule ſay.) I will name two or three notes, by which thou mayſt ſuſpect thy ſelfe as from probabilities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The wilderneſſe, it is <hi>an incult place;</hi> a place where the ſoyle was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tilled, it is hard almoſt as a milſtone; the over-growne Trees were never pruned, the unruly boughs never lopt, the buſhes never cut or ſtubbed: doſt thou find thy heart in ſuch a condition, that it is as hard as ever; neither judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment breaks it, nor mercy melts it, the fallow ground of it is not plowed, nor the ſeed of righteouſneſſe ſowne in it? Thy unruly luſts are not tamed, thy life is as much overgrowne with ſinne as ever it was: thy ſinnes were never yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93551:139"/> cut off from the body of thy life. O friend! ſuſpect thy ſelfe; Thou mayeſt juſtly feare, yea, and know too, that thou art not the Spouſe of Chriſt, thou art in the wilderneſſe, in thy naturall eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The wilderneſſe is <hi>a barren place,</hi> it brings forth no corne for the ſickle, no wholſome fruit, no grapes for mans pallat; for <hi>can a man gather grapes of thiſtles, or figgs of thornes?</hi> No pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures wholſome for the beaſts. <hi>The fire hath devoured the paſtures of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, Joel</hi> 1. 19. And God complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was <hi>dry like a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, Zeph.</hi> 2. 13. Art thou a barren, and unfruitfull creature, that doſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for God? thy heart is a barren heart, no ſeeds of good are ſown there; thy tongue is a barren tongue, no good words come out thence; thy whole ſoule a barren ſoule; not a good action upon the record of thy life. Indeed, no ſoule can be barren, the ſoule is of a working nature; but ſinfull works are <hi>unfruitfull workes</hi> (in the Apoſtles lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.) <hi>The unfruitfull workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>what fruits had ye of thoſe things, whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93551:140"/> Gods Spouſe is a fruitfull creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> A barren ſoule is alwayes a wilderneſſe-ſoule. Thoſe that are borne of God, bring forth fruits unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou mayeſt know whether thou beeſt in the wilderneſſe or no, by the company thou delighteſt in: It is a knowne rule, <hi>Noſcitur ex ſocio qui non dignoſcitur ex ſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is a wilderneſſe-creature, loves wilderneſſe-company; the Wolves, and Beares, and Foxes: but he that is out, keeps the company of men; doſt thou love the wilderneſſe-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? the ſwiniſh drunkard, the politike Fox, the malitious Lyon, the venomous lyer and ſlanderer, the laſcivious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, more than the Children of God? Oh ſuſpect thy ſelfe! <hi>By this we know</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) that we are tranſlated from death to life if we love the Brethren. Lazarus</hi> when he was raiſed from the grave, we do not read he went to keep the dead men company againe: thoſe that God hath raiſed from the death of their ſins, live amongſt living men, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93551:140"/> delight in living mens company. Thus examine whether thou beeſt come out of the wilderneſſe of ſin, or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As comming out of the wilderneſſe is a ſigne of the child of God: ſo being in the wilderneſſe, is likewiſe a note whereby thou mayeſt know thy ſelfe. Gods Spouſe comes out of one wilderneſſe into another, out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of ſorrow, and out of that to their Saviour. Wouldeſt thou know whether thou art found, or no; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether thou wert loſt or no:</hi> Wouldeſt thou know whether ever thou wert a beleever; examine whether ever thou wert a penitent, or not. This is Gods ordinary way; thence he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of his people, that <hi>they would not repent, that they might beleeve in him.</hi> Doſ thou find God in another manner of working in thy ſoule? bleſſe God for it; and if thy title be good to heaven, which will be knowne by thy walking with God, beleeve me, God hath uſed thee kindly, heaven hath coſt thee cheaper then it coſts many a poore ſoule; and walke humbly before God,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93551:141"/> becauſe he hath not <hi>humbled thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mighty hand,</hi> as he hath done many another poore creatures: And though I would not condemne thoſe that plead their title to heaven this way, for feare I ſhould condemne <hi>the generation of the righteous,</hi> yet beleeve me, I ſhould ſuſpect it in my owne cauſe. <hi>They that goe out weeping, and carry precious ſeed, ſhall returne rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and bring their ſheaves with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Examine thy ſelfe, <hi>What other wilderneſſes thou meeteſt with? Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, temptations,</hi> &amp;c. I would not give this as an infallible marke, yet God ſayes, <hi>whom he loves he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:</hi> and thence the Father drew out his Concluſion, <hi>Unicum Deus habuit filium ſine peccato, nullum ſine flagello;</hi> God had one Sonne without ſinne, but none without a rod. But I know, even the wicked ſometimes begin their hell upon the earth: and though I would ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my ſelfe if I met with no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet I would not be glad to have a life full of croſſes and afflictions, my beſt evidence for heaven. I rather na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93551:141"/> this for a preface to the next note.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Examine <hi>how thou carrieſt thy ſelfe in the wilderneſſe;</hi> there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent carriage betwixt the child of God, and the child of the Devill in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the one ſinkes into the grave with deſpaire, the other lifts up his head to <hi>Sion</hi> with hope: the one is preſt to death under croſſes, the other above all croſſes. <hi>Cain</hi> cries, <hi>my puniſhment is too heavy for me to beare; Job</hi> cries, <hi>though he ſhould kill me, yet I will truſt in him:</hi> The Reprobate cryes, Who is <hi>the Lord that I ſhould wait for him?</hi> The Saint ſayes, <hi>I will patiently wait for the Lords Salvation:</hi> the wicked man dyes, the Saint leanes: the eyes of the ſinners faile that day; but the Saints look up to <hi>Sion,</hi> from whence comes their helpe that day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Examine <hi>How thou haſt come out of thy wilderneſſe?</hi> of thine owne ſtrength or leaning? Canſt thou ſay, That God <hi>knew thee in the wilderneſſe, in the land of great drought,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 5. If thou thinkeſt thou cameſt out alone, thou art there ſtil, What gave thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the depths of ſorrow? what?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93551:142"/> thy merry company? did thy duties do it? If any thing did it but thy Chriſt, I feare thou art ſtill in the Wilderneſſe: when thou didſt mourne, <hi>as one that mourneth for his onely begotten ſonne,</hi> diſt thou <hi>look upon him whom thou hadſt pierced?</hi> there is nothing but the blood of Chriſt can give a cordiall to a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule; nothing but the hand-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of free grace that can wipe thine eyes; nothing but the blotting out of the hand-writing, which was written in Gods Booke, and thy owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt thee, that can make thy heart leave trembling, and thy knees leave beating together for terror. Thou canſt not come out alone, if ever thou cameſt out, it was leaning.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Examine thy ſelfe, <hi>How thou haſt carried thy ſelfe ſince thou cameſt out?</hi> How haſt thou beene ſince thou wert humbled, and loſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſorrow? What effects hath the wilderneſſe of ſorrow wrought upon thee? Hath thy ſorrow beene like the ſorrow of <hi>Achan,</hi> that thou haſt been onely ſorry becauſe thou haſt been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Attachment of wrath? Or like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93551:142"/> 
                     <hi>Ahab, renting his cloathes, putting on his ſack-cloth, and going ſoftly?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. Or like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned? Exod.</hi> Or like <hi>Balaam,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>I have ſinned, I will returne back againe?</hi> when he might have had more thanks for his labour and never have come there, he had checks enough. Art thou worſe when thou commeſt out of the wilderneſſe of affliction, that wee may brand thee with <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Brand, <hi>This was that King Ahaz?</hi> Or doeſt thou come out of thy Afflictions leaning, with thy weak faith ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thy ſtrong faith confirmed? Haſt thou loſt no graines, but got in the fire? Is thy gold as good weight now as before? it is a good ſigne it is good then. But I haſten to the next Uſe, which may be to informe us;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The ſad condition that all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers are in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The joyfull condition that all the Children of God are in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The great love of God, that he would ſend Chriſt to ſeeke us up in the wilderneſſe, and give his hand to</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93551:143"/> 
                     <hi>poore creatures to lead them out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, If in every wilderneſſe wee muſt leane upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>It may informe us, what need wee have at all times to walke cloſe with the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, here ſee the ſad condition that all men and women by nature are in, that have not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It conſiſts in two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are in a wilderneſſe:</hi> Sinne is a wilderneſſe. Now which of you (friends) but would thinke himſelfe as good as a dead man if he were in the midſt of an <hi>Arabian</hi> deſert, that he could not ſee any poſſibilitie of getting out, nor any comfort he could enjoy there: terror on every ſide, comfort on no ſide; the Lyons and beaſts of prey of every hand ready to devour him, and it is well if he can keepe his fleſh for food for himſelfe, for he can get no proviſion for his body, nothing, except he would eate the barke of trees, or the parched graſſe. What man would not tremble, to thinke of one that ſhould be condemned to ſuch an axile? Doe not your hearts pittie as oft as you think of thoſe poore men that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93551:143"/> were left but halfe a yeare in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> And yet O Lord! How few pittie themſelves! O poore creatures! <hi>Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur;</hi> the Story is thy owne, apply it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: You that are in your ſinnes are all in a ſad wilderneſſe; the judgements of God, like the beaſts of prey, are ready to ſwallow you up on every hand; 'tis a miracle of mercy you are not in hell; there is but a thread betwixt you and death; the Sword of Gods wrath hangs over your head, while you are at your Drunken Banquets of ſinne: Oh! what comfort? what joy can can you have in the wilderneſſe (friends?) that when you lye downe at night, you know not but you may wake in the morning paſt Repentance, even with Hell flames about you; as the Lord lives, there is but a haires breadth betwixt you and Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>That you have no one to helpe you out of any wilderneſſe;</hi> if Chriſt be not yours, nothing is yours: what will you doe in a ſtormy day of Affliction, when you ſhall cry unto God, and he ſhall ſay unto you, as he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93551:144"/> once ſaid to the roaring <hi>Iſralites,</hi> Jud. 10. 14. <hi>Goe, and cry unto the gods which you have choſen; let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you in the time of your tribulation.</hi> Cry unto your Gold now, unto your Luſts now, truſt your Riches now, make you a golden Calfe! See if it will now ſave you. O think! You that live in ſinne, and love and delight in ſinne, what ſhall I doe in a ſad day of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when the feare of the grave ſhall ſurround me, and the terrors of Hell ſhall make me afraid? What ſhall I leane upon when theſe comforts ſhall be no comforts? when I ſhall ſay to all creature-enjoyments, <hi>miſerable comforters are you all.</hi> Where ſhall I warme me when theſe flaſhes will be out? when the ſparkes of pleaſure and profit ſhall be choakt, and kill'd with the duſt and aſhes of my grave? Heare yee this all yee, <hi>That kinde a fire, that compaſſe your ſelves about with ſparkes; walke in the light of your fire, and in the ſparkes that you have kindled; This ſhall ye have at the Lords hand, you ſhall lye downe in ſorrow:</hi> Your pleaſurable ſinnes are but as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93551:144"/> ſparks (Sirs,) What will you doe when your ſparkes are out? They are (as we ſay of a ſhort flame) but a Widdowes joy for a moment: Take heed, that when your ſparks are out, you blow not your nailes in hell: Take heed, that your ſparkes doe not kindle everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings for you. What will you doe in a wilderneſſe of Affliction? how will you come out? what will you come out? What will yee leane upon?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This may ſerve to informe us of the happpy condition of Gods children, and that <hi>è contrario,</hi> in a juſt poſition to the others miſery: <hi>O lift up your heads yee righteous,</hi> and be <hi>glad yee upright in heart:</hi> Your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſts in theſe two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>You are out of the wilderneſſe,</hi> out of the danger of Hell; and thoſe that can ſpell in their thoughts but that word <hi>hell,</hi> will know it to be a mercy to be out of the feare of it. You are out of the wilderneſſe, O bleſſe that God that hath helpt you out: 'tis a great happineſſe to be delivered of feares; beleeve me! Did the wicked men ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thinke what a weight of wrath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93551:145"/> they lye under, what a cloud of bloud hangs over their heads, they would pray till all their knees were melted (though they were all ſteele) to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it. Hold up your hands that you have eſcaped a drowning; that you feare not the wild beaſts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the wilderneſſe; Gods dreadfull judgements you dare meet, the Lyon and the Beare, and they dare not ſet the print of their teeth upon you. A godly man is like a man under protection, he owes much, but the Bayliffe dares not meddle with him; Chriſt hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the debt for him, he is under the protection of the Sonne of God; he can looke a Judgement in the face, and never run for it. The wicked man, on the contrary, is like one that hangs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every buſh (as we ſay) owes more than he is worth; he dares ſcarſe looke out of the doores whiles the Bayliffes are about: when the judgements of God are about, the wicked wretch dares not looke out, he ſinks into his grave in the thoughts of it. This Plague, this Feaver, this Ague, may be a Bayliffe to arreſt me, that God hath ſent to carry
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93551:145"/> me bound hand and foot and throwne into Hell, where is weeping and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and gnaſhing of teeth. And then thinks with himſelfe (O that they did ſo!) Where is my ſurety (if it ſhould be ſo?) who would be bound for the payment of the Debt due for my ſinnes, and to be paid at Gods Judgement Seat? The godly man, he likewiſe ſaith; This Plague, this Feaver, this Sickneſſe, may arreſt me: But ſuppoſe they ſhould, the Son of God is bound for my Debt; My Judge ſurely will not demand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Surety then his owne Sonne. I bleſſe God I am out of the wilderneſſe: O happy man! Here's a portion of thy happineſſe; but here is not all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, That if thou ſhouldeſt fall into the corner of another wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>Thou haſt one to leane upon, even in every wilderneſſe:</hi> If thou ſhouldſt have a rod upon thy backe, thou haſt a ſtaffe to comfort thee. Thou haſt one to lead thee out, whenſoever thou art in: an arme that thou mayeſt truſt to. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that hath a friend in the Court, ſuch is thy friend. A friend in adverſity, is better than a brother, (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93551:146"/> thou haſt a friend in adverſity, and he is thy brother: Thy brother Chriſt is thy friend, that will lead thee through, and out of every wilderneſſe. Is the childe happy, that in want hath a father to run unto? the wife happy, that hath a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in time of ſickneſſe to comfort her? The ſervant happy, that hath a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in adverſity to pitty him? then I dare pronounce thee in all times happy: Thy husband loves thee, thy father ſends his ſon to lead thee, thy husband is alwayes by to comfort thee, and lead thee by his hand. God hath ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 11. <hi>That he will guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy ſoule in drought, and make fat thy bones.</hi> Thou haſt alwayes a friend at need, a brother in adverſity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is it ſo that the Spouſe comes out of the wilderneſſe <hi>leaning upon her Beloved?</hi> This may then ſhew us the infinite love of God to the creature; that he would be pleaſed to looke us up in the wilderneſſe, and let us leane upon him: Chriſt was led into the wildernes becauſe thou wert there, he had a bad journey to fetch thee nome: Oh! what ſhould? what could (beſides his infinite
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93551:146"/> free-grace) make his bowels of mercy ſo yerne towards the creature, as to look it up in the wilderneſſe, to cloath it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to waſh it polluted, to ſave it dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Chriſt the ſhepheard had loſt his ſtray ſheep, and goes after that which was loſt in the wilderneſſe untill he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, then he layeth it on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and bringeth it home. O, bleſſed be the name of the Lord for his free grace and mercy! The ſhepheard followed the ſheep, whiles the ſheep regarded not the ſhepheard; we were in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, he came to find us out. O! was not this infinite love, aſtoniſhing mercy?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Is it ſo? that we muſt come out of every wilderneſſe leaning upon our Beloved? O then let this informe us what need we have to walk cloſe with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; what need we have to be fearfull of offending, and carefull to pleaſe him: It is he that muſt help us in every need, he that muſt lead us in every wilderneſſe: If he forſakes us we are undone. Have we but one friend? let us keep him then: if we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, we loſe our beſt friend. Hath the ſhiftleſſe child need to keep the love
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93551:147"/> of the Father? the Babe need to keep in the armes of the Nurſe? the wife need to keep the love of the husband? the blind man need to keep the love of his guid? O Chriſtian, thou haſt much more need to keep the love of thy Chriſt: It is he that muſt ſuccour thee at every need; he that muſt make the rugged wayes plaine for thee; It is he that muſt carry the Babe of grace in his armes, leſt it ſhould daſh its feet againſt the ſtones of affliction: It is he that muſt lead the child of God upon his hand, leſt in this world of afflictions it fall, and hurt it ſelf. O keep cloſe in his armes, keep thy ſelfe warme in his boſome; feare that which may make thy God go free from thee. Gods departing from the creature is a piece of hell: thou knoweſt not how ſoone thou mayeſt need him; yea, thou alwayes needeſt him, therefore take heed of ſinning againſt him; thou wilt anger thy beſt friend, I will aſſure thee.</p>
                  <p>I haſten to the laſt Uſe, which ſhall be a word of Exhortation: Doth the Spouſe of Chriſt come out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe leaning upon her Beloved?</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93551:147"/>
                  <p> Firſt, O then, you that are yet in the wilderneſſe of ſinnes, come out, come out, get this Spouſes Beloved, and then leane upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that are in the wilderneſſe of ſorrow for ſinne, afflictions, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſertions, leane upon your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, live leaning and dye leaning: you that ſay you are ſinking, and you cannot beleeve. Oh leane and come out of this wilderneſſe leaning upon your Beloved.</p>
                  <p>A word to the firſt: Is there any before the Lord this day that is yet in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity, with what arguments ſhall I plead with ſuch a ſoule? Thoſe are not wanting, but with what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall I prevaile with ſuch a ſoul, to come unto the Lord Chriſt? were any here drowning in the water, a little Rhetoricke would perſwade them to let me helpe them out? were any loſt in a wood, I ſhould not need much entreat them to give me their hand, and I would ſhew them a way out of that looſing place? why ſhould I not as much prevaile for heaven this day?</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93551:148"/> 1 Conſider <hi>what eſtate it is that thou takeſt ſuch pleaſure to continue in?</hi> firſt, it is a <hi>dangerous place,</hi> more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then the ſands to the ſhip: thou art ready to be ſwallowed up of hell every houre in it. A troop of judgments waites upon thee to deſtroy it; how canſt thou abide conſuming fire? or dwell in everlaſting burnings?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, it is a <hi>joyleſſe condition:</hi> There is no true joy to the ſinner, though he ſings ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his drunken cups, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feed heartily upon a feaſt of joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sword hangs over his head, it is but a fained joy that the ſinner hath, a ſudden ſhort lived flame, without any coales underneath to preſerve it. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked</hi> (ſaith God) and if no peace, there can be no joy; when the ſinner is ſerious he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rejoyce, his rejoycing is like the skipping of mad men that know not what they doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, it is a <hi>ſtarving condition;</hi> The ſinners ſoule ſtarves whiles he feaſts his body like a glutton, his ſoule dyes for thirſt, when his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93551:148"/> is overſlowne with drunkenneſſe. It is impoſſible the puffe-paſt of iniquity ſhould nouriſh a ſoule: Doth an Angell feed upon the earth? doth a Saint feed upon hell? The ſoule is of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicke ſubſtance; it cannot feed upon ſinne: ſinne ſtarves it. Doſt thou love to be in the middeſt of thornes? doſt thou delight to lye downe in ſorrow? canſt thou endure to ſee thy better part ſtarved, whiles thou pampereſt thy filthy Carcaſſe? O let this deterre thee from the wilderneſſe of ſinne, and perſwade thee to come out of it unto Paradiſe. There,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt be in a ſafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Out of the feare of judgements, out of hells gunſhot: There life or death will be either peace temporall, or elſe eternall, either grace, or glory unto thee; here thy ſoule ſhall be in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if thouſands fall at thy left hand, and ten thouſands at thy right: none ſhall make the afraid, thou ſhalt laugh at trouble when it comes. Thou ſhalt be ſure to goe to heaven either by land, or water: If thou goeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt be ſure to have Chriſt with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93551:149"/> thee. Heaven is a ſecurity in all eſtates, a protection from all Arreſts, if the King of glory hath a mind to ſue thee, thou ſhalt not be arreſted (like other men) with a writ of wrath, but invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſup with him in glory, onely by a letter of love, and he will ſend his Uſhers of glory to waite upon thy ſoul to the chambers of glory, <hi>Luke,</hi> 16. 22. The ſoule of good <hi>Lazarus was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Angels into Abrahams boſome:</hi> you ſhall not live like other men, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the blood-hounds of wrath, nor dye like other wretches, that goe out of the world, haled by the Sarjeants of hell to everlaſting priſon; but quietly ſleepe, and awake againe one day in glory. O who would not deſire ſuch a protection for himſelfe? ſuch a ſecurity for his ſoule? who would not throw off his raggs of ſinne, to put on Chriſts livery of grace, when Chriſts badge upon his ſhoulder ſhall free him from all Arreſts? That he ſhall walke up and downe, and nothing ſhall make him afraid?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that <hi>Heaven is a place as full of joy, as ever the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:93551:149"/> 
                     <hi>was full of ſorrow and trouble;</hi> of this I ſpake before. O thinke of the joy of the Saints, you children of vaine pleaſure, you mad-men of the earth, that can dance <hi>over the hole of the Aſpe,</hi> and <hi>put your hands on the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices den.</hi> Your falſe and flattering joy is nothing to the reall joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; There is joy <hi>like the joy of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, like the joy when men divide the ſpoyle:</hi> The yoake of their <hi>burthen is broken,</hi> and the rod of the oppreſſour. O you that love your drinking meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and dancing dayes, that you would but love heaven, where you might drink new wine with your Lord Chriſt: where you might dance in glory, and make all your dayes, dayes of joy, and every houre, an houre of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider, that <hi>there, and there onely, is proviſion for your ſoule.</hi> Chriſts robes is the only cloathing that will cover the nakedneſſe of it; <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed,</hi> and <hi>his bloud is drinke indeed;</hi> there my friends, <hi>Eate and drinke, and be merry,</hi> there you may have wine and milke, <hi>without</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93551:150"/> 
                     <hi>money, or without price. O, ſpend not your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which profits not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may <hi>eate that which is good, and let your ſoule delight it ſelfe in fatneſſe.</hi> Here is a Feaſt of fat things; <hi>The fatlings are killed:</hi> O come to the wedding! Why ſhould your roomes be emptie in the day of the Lords Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals? You ſhall bee welcome to my Maſters Table: Now, O now, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he ſtands at the doore and knocks:</hi> (Lord, breake where thou knockeſt) <hi>If any man will heare his voice, and open the doore, he will come into him, and ſup with him,</hi> and he ſhall <hi>ſup with him.</hi> O let me intreat you, to pittie the yern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Saviours bowels toward you; pittie the groaning of his tender heart for you; pittie your ſelves, if not your Chriſt; and, O come, come out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne into this wilderneſſe of ſorrow; that of a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken profane creature, thou mayeſt be a mourning pious ſoule; of a proud care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſinner, become a poore humbled paenitent; that the world may admire, <hi>Saul</hi> amongſt the Prophets, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93551:150"/> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the Apoſtles, and thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Saints of Chriſt; and ſay of thee, who art now a profane Swearer and Blaſephemer, <hi>Behold he Prayeth!</hi> Of thee that wert a filthy Wanton, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he Mournes! Of thee that wert a filthy Drunkard and Glutton, Behold he faſts! And may in time ſay of thee, <hi>Who is this that commeth up from the wilderneſſe leaning upon her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is there any before the Lord this day, that is in any other wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of Sorrow, Affliction, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Deſertion, &amp;c? O leane! Come out of your <hi>wilderneſſe leaning upon your Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Is there any one here, to whom the Lord hath ſhewne their owne ſad condition too, and yet hath not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fulneſſe of his free grace to them? O leane upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and leaning come out of thy wilderneſſe; <hi>Beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> But here's the hard taske, to perſwade ſuch a ſoule to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Conſider but theſe few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That <hi>now thou art in a capacitie of</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93551:151"/> 
                     <hi>beleeving.</hi> Povertie of ſpirit is the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt capacitie of faith; <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Now thou art weary, Chriſt hath promiſed to eaſe thee; now thou art heavy laden, he hath promiſed to help thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that <hi>thou haſt ground enough to build thy faith upon;</hi> Chriſts power and love are two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, able to hold up the weakeſt faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Beleeve; leane upon Chriſt, for he is able to pardon thy ſinnes; thou ſhouldeſt blaſpheme in thy thoughts if thou ſhouldeſt not thinke this. Can infinite mercy be fadomed thinkeſt thou? Can any one plead his underſervings againſt free grace? Were thy burthen farre heavier then it is, caſt it upon Chriſt, for he is able to beare it; Art thou thick darkneſſe? he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite light: Art thou all ſinne? he is all pardon: Art thou altogether lovely? why Chriſt is altogether lovely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Beleeve; becauſe <hi>Chriſt is as much love as he is power:</hi> he is not only able, but he is willing to pardon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93551:151"/> thee; free grace thirſts after thee. Nay, beleeve me, thou canſt give Chriſt no greater ſatisfaction then to receive his mercies. Chriſt is with child of free grace (to ſpeake it with reverence) and he deſires nothing more then to be delivered in thine heart. He is a Sea of mercy, and he would rejoyce to empty himſelfe by drops into his peoples hearts. But why did I ſay empty? Can the Sun loſe any light by communicating his light to others? When the creature ſpeaks of God, he muſt ſpeake <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he would fill thee, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue full himſelfe. He is ſatisfied when thou art full. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travell of his ſoule, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Thou art not ſo willing to receive, as he is to beſtow free grace. O then lean upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, <hi>that canſt not diſhonour thy God; more then when thou art humbled by him for thy ſins, and caſt downe in thine owne thoughts, and cal'd to beleeve in his mercies, and ſecured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his word, if thou wilt but truſt him.</hi> If thou wilt not, then beleeve in him, Surely then thou art of a little faith, if not an Infidell. Thou couldſt not beleeve when thou wert an impaenitent hard-hearted creature. Why? becauſe thou kneweſt no need thou hadſt of faith: Neither couldſt thou hear Chriſts invitation, becauſe thou wert not weary and heavie loaden; but now that the Lord hath humbled thee, now the promiſes belong unto thee; what? dareſt thou not take Chriſts
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93551:152"/> word? Suppoſe a Traytour were condemned to dye, and the King ſhould ſend a Pardon by the hand of his owne Son to this forlorne wretch, and he ſhould refuſe it, ſaying; <hi>The King cannot pardon me; what hath he to do to ſend me a Pardon? I know he doth but mock me, he meanes nothing leſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Were not this a peice of unworthineſſe, by which he ſhould diſhonour his Prince as much as with his Treaſon before? O take heed of provoking the Lord ſtill; it is enough that thou haſt provoked him once, yet he will pardon thee. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thou canſt not honour Chriſt more then in beleeving; for thou acknowledgeſt the unfadom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depth of his free love and mercy; Thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clameſt God, to be a God, gracious, long-ſuffering, a God that may be truſted by the creature which hath deſerved nothing at his hand; that he is ſo pure an Eſſence of love, that he will create himſelf a cauſe of love where is none. And though he coould find nothing in thee to pardon thee, for thy ſake, yet he would pardon thee for his owne Name ſake.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe, you that are in any wilderneſſe, or ſhall be, of Affliction, Deſertion, Temptation, &amp;c. <hi>O leane! leane!</hi> Tis that which God requires at your hand; 'tis that which will eaſe you when you are weary; help you when you are heavie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; Beleeving will eaſe you when complaining will not; 'tis that which honours God, and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93551:152"/> Chriſt; It gives him the glory of his Power, and Providence, &amp; Dominion, and free Grace, and mercy. Chriſt, beleeve me, will take it kindly at your hands, that you will try him in need, and truſt him even in deſpaire; though he kills you, yet you will truſt in him. Thoſe that venture upon Death with ſuch a faith cannot dye: Thoſe that have ſuch a Spirit muſt live eternally. The way to live, is to dye beleeving, and the way to ſtand, is to leane falling. O come all yee that love the Lord truſt in his mercies: I have done, only I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with my Text.</p>
                  <p>O you that are falling, as you think into the pit of deſpaire, that are loſt in the wilderneſſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: <hi>Beleeve, beleeve, and you ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Come out truſting upon God; reſting upon the fulneſſe of his mercy, and the freeneſſe of his grace; come out, come out <hi>leaning upon your Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O you that are in a wilderneſſe of <hi>afflictions,</hi> lean upon Gods ſtaffe, let his rod comfort you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he ſmileth while he ſmiteth thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in affliction you ſhall have <hi>no more then you are able to beare;</hi> he will let <hi>his grace be ſufficient for you,</hi> and all ſhall worke for your good. And come you out of your wilderneſſe <hi>leaning upon your Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O you that are in the wilderneſſe of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the ſnare of the Devill, beleeve, and leane, your Chriſt was tempted, and he knowes how to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted: leane upon him to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93551:153"/> beare you up in, and to give you an happy iſſue out of your temptations in which you are in, <hi>for the triall of your faith;</hi> and come you out likewiſe <hi>leaning upon your Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You that are in the wildernes of Deſertion, cry, My God! though you be forſaken, keep your faith, retaine your Intereſt; O leane, loſe not your hold you have upon the Almighty, leane in: and <hi>come out of this your wilderneſſe leaning upon your Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally All you that are in the wilderneſſe of ſin; the worſt wilderneſſe of all: Let me conclude with you, And once more as the Embaſſadour of Jeſus Chriſt in my Maſters name, as if he himſelfe were here: I beſeech you, by the many, and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of him, whoſe bowels yerne towards you, by his precious bloud, which was powred out upon the Croſſe for ſinners (and who knowes whether not for you; as well as others) as you tender the life &amp; happines of your own ſouls, the joy of your faithfull Paſtors: nay, (which is moſt of all) as you tender the honour of God, come out, O come out of your ſad wilderneſſe! be humbled, and mourne, ſit downe in duſt and aſhes, that you may riſe up, adorned with grace, and be crowned with glory, that you may leane upon your Beloved; and O that my firſt or laſt words might prevaile with ſome great ſinner this day for whom we might all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, concerning whom we might all ſay, <hi>who is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that comes out of the wilderneſſe leaning upon her beloved.</hi>

                     <hi>fire and water to him,</hi> then wee muſt forget them. I have ſomewhere met with a Speech of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> to that purpoſe: Saith hee, <hi>If the Lord Chriſt ſhould call me to him, though my Father ſhould lye in my way, and my Mother ſhould hang about my neck, I would goe over my Father, and ſhake off my Mother, and runne to my Chriſt. Shetterden</hi> a Martyr (as it is ſtoried of him) writ to his Mother thus; <hi>Dear Mother, imbrace the Counſell of Gods Word with Heart and Affection, read it with obedience, ſo ſhall we meet in joy at the laſt day, Or elſe I bid you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for ever.</hi> In theſe now and ſuch like caſes, that ſoule that would make its beauty <hi>deſireable</hi> in the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt like <hi>Levi</hi> ſay to his <hi>Father</hi> and his <hi>Mother, I have not ſeen you;</hi> in theſe caſes he muſt not <hi>acknowledge</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> nor <hi>know his owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> They ſtand in Chriſts way, and Chriſt calls <hi>haſtily.</hi> The Saint muſt ſpare no time to <hi>parley.

Now all this muſt be forgotten, or elſe in ſtead of <hi>being ſaved,</hi> thy ſoule will bee <hi>deſtroied.</hi> Prov. 13. 20. <hi>A Companion of fooles ſhall bee deſtroied.</hi> Pſalme 119. 63. <hi>I am a companion</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) of thoſe that fear thee.</hi> You muſt leave your <hi>ſwearing Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and your <hi>drinking Company,</hi> and your <hi>vain Company,</hi> or the King will never <hi>deſire</hi> your <hi>beauty.</hi> The ſoul that would render it ſelfe <hi>deſireable</hi> in the eyes of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt make all its delight, (with <hi>David)</hi> in thoſe that <hi>excell in vertue,</hi> the Saints upon the earth. <hi>Saul</hi> before his <hi>Converſion</hi> was a companion of thoſe that <hi>ſtoned Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> and perſecuted the <hi>Saints.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſoule that would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its <hi>beauty deſireable in Jeſus</hi>

Hee that is greateſt amongſt them that are Saints, muſt be as a Servant,</hi> Matth. 23. 7, 8, 9, 10. They muſt forget that <hi>naturall itching</hi> which is in the children of <hi>Adam</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, and muſt be ſcratched with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> or <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or ſome <hi>high-ſwelling words of vanity:</hi> they muſt not bee ſuch, as will ſwell (like that Toad <hi>Haman)</hi> if <hi>Mordecay</hi> give him not the <hi>knee,</hi> or if their <hi>Brother</hi> give them

                  <p>The ſoule that would render its beauty deſirable in Chriſts eyes, muſt

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt of all it implies, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall diſcover and ſee an excellency in ſuch a ſoule;</hi> we can <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing,</hi> but we ſhall firſt diſcover ſome <hi>excellency in it.</hi> Now the Lord diſcovers an <hi>excellency</hi> in ſuch a ſoule; hee ſhall eye ſuch a ſoule as an <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> ſoule, as a <hi>lovely ſoule,</hi> worthy of him (though not through its owne <hi>worthineſſe)</hi> and <hi>ſuitable</hi> for him.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. It implies, <hi>That the Lord Chriſt will in his heart preferre ſuch a ſoule;</hi> when a mans <hi>deſire</hi> is towards a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular woman,</hi> to make her his wife, he

                  <p n="4">4. It implies, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will</hi>

                     <hi>indeavour and effect an union, and enjoy ſuch a ſoule;</hi> what is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>the man's deſire ſhall be to his wife,</hi> but he ſhall deſire to <hi>be joyned in marriage to her,</hi> that they may bee <hi>no longer twaine, but one fleſh?</hi> and if his deſire be towards her, and it be a <hi>feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> thing he will effect it, if <hi>ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and friends conſent, &amp;c. <hi>The Lords deſire ſhall be to the ſoule,</hi> that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall indeavour, yea, and unite himſelfe to effect an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch a ſoul, he ſhall wooe it, yea, and ſhee ſhall <hi>yield,</hi> for when hee <hi>works who can let him?</hi> Chriſt will marry himſelfe to ſuch a ſoule, make a marriage <hi>covenant,</hi> and <hi>tie himſelfe</hi> in a <hi>marriage</hi> bond to it; for though in man deſire may bee fruſtrated, ſo that deſire and enjoyment are two things, yet it is neceſſarily to be underſtood in <hi>Chriſts deſiring,</hi> whoſe power is ſuch, that hee ſhall not need ſtarve his deſire longer than he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It implies, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will court neare communion with ſuch a ſoule; mark how he ſpeaks to the Spouſe, Cant. 2. 14. <hi>O my</hi>

                  <p n="6">6.

As I have gone along in opening the generals in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall particulars, I have proved the Doctrine that it is ſo. But may ſome ſay, what ground is there that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould deſire this of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule that hee will <hi>love and marry</hi> and have <hi>communion</hi> with, that it ſhould thus forſake <hi>its owne people,</hi> and its <hi>fathers houſe?</hi> why ſhould Chriſt hold the ſoule to this hard meat? I ſhal
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93551:184"/> therefore in the next place ſhew you the reaſons of it: And there is a very great deale of Reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it is the very law of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> Gen. 2. 24. <hi>Therefore ſhall a man forſake father and mother, and cleave to his wife.</hi> The Lord Chriſt marries himſelfe to the ſoule. It is written, <hi>I will betroth thee unto mee; yea, I will betroth thee unto mee:</hi> for this cauſe the ſoule ſhall forſake its owne people, and its fathers houſe, and ſhall cleave to its Chriſt; <hi>for this cauſe</hi> becauſe the ſoule is <hi>married,</hi> or <hi>about to marry</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore muſt look to doe as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perſons uſe to doe, leave all for their husband.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon is, <hi>becauſe while the ſoule lives at home with its owne people, and at its fathers houſe, it cannot be beautifull nor deſirable.</hi> Our owne people are a <hi>filthie people,</hi> our <hi>fathers houſe</hi> a naſtie houſe; the ſoule while it hath left that cannot be <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull</hi> nor <hi>deſirable.</hi> The moſt <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature</hi> you know, if ſhee bee brought up by ſluttiſh people (as wee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93551:184"/> ſay) and goes in a <hi>filthy habit,</hi> there is a <hi>cloud</hi> caſt over her <hi>beauty.</hi> So it is with a ſoule, while it hath left its <hi>ſins and vaine company,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-righteouſneſſe,</hi> it cannot be <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in Chriſts eyes.</hi> Now beauty is the <hi>attractive</hi> of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> the ſoule muſt ſee a <hi>beauty,</hi> in that, which it <hi>lets out it ſelfe</hi> to in <hi>deſiring:</hi> let that be a ſecond reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>there cannot bee a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Chriſt, unleſſe there be a parting with theſe.</hi> Chriſt requires the <hi>higheſt love</hi> of our ſoules, it is the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement you know (with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours gloſſe upon it) <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy ſoule.</hi> Hence Chriſt tels us, <hi>no man can ſerve two maſters, you cannot ſerve God and Mammon;</hi> that ſoule that will <hi>hug ſin</hi> muſt <hi>hate God;</hi> that ſoule that will be a <hi>companion of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>companion of Saints,</hi> muſt not be a <hi>companion of ſinners, for what fellowſhip hath Chriſt with Belial, righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe, light with darkneſſe, the temple of God</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:93551:213"/> or the <hi>force of</hi> his owne <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> But to come out of <hi>trouble</hi> this way, ſhall bring no <hi>comfort to the ſoule.</hi> This is but breaking <hi>priſon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>faire diſmiſſion,</hi> or <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jaylors fees;</hi> Troubles will <hi>overtake</hi> ſuch ſoules, with an <hi>hue and crie,</hi> and fetter them in a <hi>worſer</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and God will againe <hi>arreſt</hi> them upon <hi>quare clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum fregit,</hi> an <hi>heavier action</hi> than before. But by this ſhall a Chriſtian know, if the <hi>wound</hi> of the ſpirit bee <hi>healed,</hi> it is with the <hi>balme of Gilead;</hi> if he hath come out of <hi>trouble fairly,</hi> hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:93551:213"/> come out upon <hi>Goſpell-conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</hi> The peace in <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that is not found in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not <hi>worth</hi> the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up; and from it a Chriſtian ſhall extract no comfortable <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>peace</hi> to his owne ſoule, but in his <hi>peace</hi> hee ſhall <hi>have great bitterneſſe.</hi> I have often thought that a <hi>watching</hi> Chriſtian might bee juſtly troubled, to conſider ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, how hee comes off a trouble; for it is uſuall with us, either to let nature <hi>tyre</hi> out it ſelfe, and when our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are <hi>ridden</hi> off their <hi>legges,</hi> then they lie downe.
<pb facs="tcp:93551:214"/> or elſe, to conclude it upon <hi>morall principles.</hi> Thus if our <hi>ſpirits</hi> bee ſick, as if there were <hi>no God in Iſrael,</hi> wee for the moſt part <hi>ſend to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, the God of Ekron,</hi> and forſake the <hi>ciſtern of living waters,</hi> to digge up to our ſelves <hi>ciflernes that will hold no water,</hi> or if any, none long.

They lived under the <hi>protection</hi> of his wings. Hee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93551:216"/> begins his Sermon with, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, you believe in God, believe alſo in mee.</hi> The whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is partly an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> partly a <hi>conſolation;</hi> hee exhorts them chiefely to <hi>continuance in the faith,</hi> and <hi>to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love;</hi> hee <hi>comforts</hi> them, partly againſt <hi>his death,</hi> partly <hi>againſt their owne death,</hi> and partly <hi>againſt that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> which he knew would uſher in their death, and be intermediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his <hi>departure</hi> from them, and their <hi>following</hi> after.

                  </p>
                  <p>In this Chapter Chriſt chiefely doth foure things. 1. Hee foretelleth them what they ſhould meet with from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſhould bee put out of the Synagogue, that they ſhould kill them, and think they did God good ſervice;</hi> and as he foretells, ſo he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> them againſt this <hi>ill meaſure,</hi> from the 1 verſe, to the 15 verſe, 2. <hi>He foretells his owne death,</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> them, in <hi>reſpect</hi> of his <hi>departure from them,</hi> from the 5 <hi>v.</hi> to the 20 <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Hee foretells their flight</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi> of him, yet before his death,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93551:216"/> and <hi>comforts</hi> himſelfe (as to that by the conſideration of his fathers <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him,</hi> which made him not to <hi>be alone,</hi> though in reſpect of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hee ſhould <hi>bee alone, v.</hi> 32. 4. Hee <hi>concludes the Sermon</hi> in this verſe which I have read to you, in which you may conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> In the <hi>world</hi> you ſhal have <hi>trouble;</hi> where note the ſubject of it <hi>you.</hi> 2. The <hi>diſeaſe</hi> it ſelfe, <gap reason="foreign">

If there bee any thing elſe needfull for the explication of the words, you ſhall have it in the explication of the Doctrine. In the words lie theſe Doctrines plaine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the world Chriſts Diſciples muſt look for trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In their trouble they may have peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt hath taken care for their peace in the midſt of trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Though the Diſciples of Chriſt meet with trouble in the world; yet they ought to be of good cheare.</hi>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93551:218"/> 5. <hi>Chriſt's overcomming of the world is a ſufficient ground of good cheare, for the Saints, in the midſt of their earthly troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot runne through all theſe at large, I ſhall ſumme up the moſt of them in one propoſition of Doctrine, and handle that more fully. It is this,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That though in the world the true Diſciples of Chriſt muſt look for troubles, yet Jeſus Chriſt hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch order, that in the midſt of their troubles, in him they may have peace.</hi> In the diſcourſing of this, for the more full orderly handling of it, I ſhall doe theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſhall ſhew you what is meant by</hi> THE WORLD, <hi>what that phraſe implies.</hi>

                  <p>You may in the Text and Doctrine, take it in all three ſenſes: The Saints</p>

                     <hi>afflictions come to us from the ſame hand &amp; the ſame cauſe that heaven, and glory, and happineſſe come.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>feare not little flock, it is your fathers will to give you a Kingdome.</hi> Wee hold that from Gods will, and he alſo ſaith, <hi>It is your fathers will to give you a croſſe;</hi> it is the will of God, that you ſhould ſuffer: ſurely then hee wills us the firſt as the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> as the <hi>meanes;</hi> the firſt <hi>ultimately,</hi> the croſſe <hi>mediately.</hi> The cauſe may lie, yea; and doth lie, in Gods <hi>ordination.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93551:223"/> therefore are the <hi>bigs</hi> of it rubd with <hi>wormewood.

Thus God is the cauſe of the Saints troubles, while they are in the world: But ſecondly,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Themſelves may be a great cauſe, yea, and are, 1. <hi>Through the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their natures,</hi> and that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I conceive, why outward croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and trials, and afflictions are called <hi>our infirmities,</hi> as becauſe they doe <hi>infirmos reddere,</hi> make us weak, by <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 5.</note> bowing downe the ſoule, and <hi>drinking up the ſpirits,</hi> or <hi>enervating the body</hi> before they leave us: So alſo, becauſe through the weakneſſe of our natures, they are troubles to us. Saints have <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> in them, and that is not able to beare ſuch a croſſe, ſuch a triall, the loſſe of ſuch a friend, of ſuch a neere and deare relation, but it muſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93551:223"/> even break them in peeces, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them. This is through their weakneſſe. You know that the <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the <hi>skin,</hi> and body, will <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> every <hi>laſh;</hi> ſo the weakneſſe of our nature makes every croſſe a <hi>double trouble,</hi> and of a <hi>double weight</hi> to a Chriſtian, and ſo he is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, through the meer weakneſſe and inability of his nature, a cauſe of his owne trouble. Secondly, <hi>Wee may be, yea, and are the proximate cauſes of them, through the ſinfulneſſe of our ſoules;</hi> wee are here <hi>full of ſinne,</hi> and it is but righteous with God, to render <hi>trouble</hi> to them that <hi>trouble</hi> him; we preſſe God with our ſinnes, <hi>as a cart is preſt with ſheaves</hi> (it is his owne ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude) no wonder if hee lades us with troubles, to the breaking of our hearts, when wee take ſuch liberty to break his lawes. I am not of their mind, that think Saints troubles come not upon them for their ſinnes: that they come not as law demands, for ſatisfaction. I grant, that they may come medicinally, or meerly for the exerciſe of faith, or patience, or ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93551:224"/> other graces, I alſo eaſily grant. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee may call them puniſhments or no (though I ſee no ſolid reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the affirmative in that nicety) I will not diſpute, but this is ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, If the Saint were not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee ſhould not bee a ſufferer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in body, nor in ſpirit, nor in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nor his relations. Death with all the appurtenances of it, death both in the egge and bird is ſinnes wages, ſinnes off-ſpring. Saints by their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, by their inconſtant and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven walkings, are cauſes of their own ſufferings, cauſes of their owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                  <p>A third head of cauſes for the Saints troubles, may be the world. And that</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the incertainty of its comforts,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 17. <hi>The world paſſeth away,</hi> and againe, 1 Cor. 7. 31. <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away; Job</hi> complaines that his <hi>welfare paſt away as a cloud, Job</hi> 30. 15. Take what you will, of the world, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, our friends paſſe away; <hi>One generation goeth, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</hi> Our proſperity paſſeth away;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93551:224"/> 
                     <hi>Job's</hi> ſunſhines had a cloud came over them. <hi>Riches take themſelves the wings of the morning and flie away:</hi> Now hence of courſe ariſeth trouble, when the heart of the creature is fixt upon a Relation, and the Generation paſſeth; the parent dies, the husband, wife, child, friend, or what ever the Relation be it is gone. <hi>Man goeth to his long home, the mourners</hi> (of courſe) <hi>goe about the ſtreets;</hi> the affection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, but the object being gone, the ſpirit is diſquieted, the heart diſſetled, &amp;c. and ſo for other things. Trouble followes of courſe upon the flitting, and paſſing away of what the heart was let out after.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The world is alſo a cauſe of the Saints troubles, <hi>In reſpect of the ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its inhabitants, the malice of them,</hi> Joh. 15. 19. <hi>Becauſe you are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> The world is very <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> in its <hi>love;</hi> it loves none but its own: <hi>If yee were of the world, the world would love its owne:</hi> The world cares for none, but thoſe that are it's owne;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93551:225"/> it hateth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all that claime <hi>kinred</hi> of him, all that are in <hi>relation</hi> to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 18. it hated Chriſt, before it hated the Saints; but hating him, it hateth thoſe that are <hi>fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones, Eph.</hi> 5. 30. Thus you ſee various cauſes of the Saints troubles, and ſo I have diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the third thing I promiſed you. The fourth followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What peace is that, that the Saint may have in Chriſt, in the midſt of this worlds troubles? how is it in Chriſt? and what paines hath Chriſt taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it? and how may the Saint get this peace, and find it out in Chriſt, and draw it from Chriſt.</hi> To this I ſhall anſwer, and firſt, wee muſt enquire <hi>what peace is; Pax eſt concordia,</hi> Peace is an agreement, ſay ſome, <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitas ordinis,</hi> a quiet of order (ſaith <hi>Aquinas)</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it drawes into an unity, <hi>unio cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium &amp; rerum,</hi> an union of hearts and actions ſay others, <hi>tranquilla constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio animorum ac rerum</hi> (ſay others) a quiet compoſure of differing ſpirits and actions; <hi>Mutuus conſenſus,</hi> ſay
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93551:225"/> others, a mutuall conſent betwixt perſons. All amount to the ſame peace <hi>is a quiet compoſed frame of ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt divers parties.</hi> Now as there are many different parties in the world to agree, and many different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon which agreements may bee; ſo there are different ſorts of peace. There is an <hi>outward peace,</hi> or an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace;</hi> a <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>men,</hi> and a <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> peace with men, may be either <hi>Politicall</hi> with Princes and <hi>ſubjects of different Kingdomes,</hi> or amongſt the <hi>ſubjects of the ſame Kingdome,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of the ſame <hi>body politick,</hi> or amongſt men of the ſame City and Corporation: contrary to forrain or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill warres and diſſentions. Or it may be <hi>domeſtick,</hi> which is an agreement betwixt Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Governours or Servants of the ſame family; or more private, betwixt party and party, call'd <hi>pax ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum,</hi> the friendſhip and agreement of friends and companions, &amp;c. All theſe now are the worlds peaces, which Chriſt puts in oppoſition to his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93551:226"/> peace, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you.</hi> There is a peace that is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chriſt's peace;</hi> It was Chriſt's <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy,</hi> hee left it by his laſt will and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> hee diſtinguiguiſheth it from all other peace whatſoever. Now in generall this is the peace that the Saints may find in Chriſt, in the midſt of this worlds troubles; it is <hi>Chriſts</hi> peace. But more particularly, what is that? what peace is that that the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give, that <hi>Chriſts peace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that peace with God, which is nothing elſe than <hi>mutuus conſenſus Dei &amp; hominis,</hi> an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, the Creator and the creature; it may be conſidered in the root, and in the fruit, in the cauſe, and in the effect, in the originall, and in the coppy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The originall is our Juſtification, <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> in Gods Court. A peace betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>ſoule,</hi> by vertue of an Act of Oblivion that the Lord hath paſſed in Heaven, concerning all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93551:226"/> the ſinners ſinnes; hee hath ſaid, <hi>I will remember your ſinnes no more,</hi> hee makes them as if they never had beene: now upon the paſſing this Act, there is an agreement concluded, betwixt God and the ſinner; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering parties are one, the peace is made, and entered in the rolls of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. God looks upon the ſinner no more as his <hi>enemy,</hi> but as his <hi>ſonne, daughter, friend,</hi> in the neareſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him. From hence ariſeth;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A piece of conſcience,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but <hi>the agreement of the ſinner within himſelfe.</hi> Conſcience that is Gods agent in the ſoule, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims no more warre, bids no more defiance; the man is at peace with himſelfe, hee dare ſay to himſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is it peace? and his conſcience ſhall make him anſwer, it is peace. Now this peace is but the ſealing up of the other in the court of the mans own boſome; A coppy of the other taken out by faith, according to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Beeing juſtified by faith wee have peace with God through our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> this is alſo Chriſt's peace.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93551:227"/> Now this peace with God, whether conſidered in the originall, or the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; it is a <hi>peace with the whole Trinity.</hi> The Father is he with whom it is made, the Sonne is he by whom it is made, the Spirit ſeales it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Nuntius pacis,</hi> the Meſſenger of that peace to the ſoule, being hee to whom it belongs of office to ſet the <hi>broad ſeale of the Court</hi> to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. But why then is it called Chriſt's peace? I eaſily anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>hee is the meritorious cauſe of it,</hi> Eph. 2. 14, 15. <hi>hee is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken downe the middle wall of partition betweene us; having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, &amp;c.</hi> v. 16. <hi>and that hee might reconcile both to God, in one body by the croſſe, having ſlaine the enmity thereby.</hi> And the ſpirit which conveyeth the newes of this peace to the ſoule, is ſometimes called his ſpirit; hee was hee that <hi>while hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon tho earth came and preached peace to them that were afarre off, and to them that were nigh,</hi> Eph. 2. 17. <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93551:227"/> 
                     <hi>through him wee have an acceſſe, by one ſpirit, unto the father,</hi> verſ. 18. God was <hi>in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinne,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Wee that preach the <hi>Goſpell of peace</hi> to you, as though God did by us beſeech you, are <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for Chriſt,</hi> and as in <hi>Chriſt's ſtead,</hi> wee entreat you to be <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God;</hi> therefore it is called his peace, and it is ſaid to bee laid up in him: and from this peace of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and peace of conſcience proceeds</p>
                  <p>A third peace, <hi>which is the peace of the members each with other</hi> (a peace which is too ſadly broken, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purſued in our dayes) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. The Saints <hi>have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their fellowſhip is with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſonne Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and could they walk together except they were agreed? And thus I have now (though in a diſcourſe ſomething too large) ſhewed you what peace is, and what this peace is that is Chriſt's peace, and that is laid up in Chriſt for the Saints, and they may find it in him in the midſt of their earthly troubles.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93551:228"/> But yet more particularly, <hi>In what of Chriſt is this peace laid up for the Saints?</hi> 2. <hi>How ſhall they come by it in the day of trouble.</hi> To each of theſe give me leave to ſpeak a word or two.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, <hi>In what of Chriſt is this peace laid up?</hi> I anſwer in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is laid up in the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> in his bitter death and paſſion, as the meritorious cauſe. This peace, Chriſtian, is written and ſealed with the <hi>bloud of the Lambe,</hi> the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lambe of God; this is cleare, in that place I before quoted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Hee reconciled us both unto God in one body by the croſſe,</hi> verſ. 13. you are made nigh by the <hi>bloud of Chriſt,</hi> his bloud was the bloud of expiation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is laid up <hi>in the word of Chriſt,</hi> in his precious promiſes. That is plaine from the very words of the Text: <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken, that in mee you might have peace. David</hi> had peace many a time, out of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the word of the Lord quickned, and comforted him; hee had once a trouble that had ſunk him, had he not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93551:228"/> found peace here; they are his owne words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I had periſhed in my affliction, if thy law had not beene my delight.</hi> The Goſpell is therefore call'd the Goſpell of <hi>peace,</hi> and the word of Chriſt, is as well the <hi>word of peace,</hi> as the <hi>word of truth:</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore ſoules have found this true, by many precious experiences; they hove been in ſpirit-troubles, <hi>heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath made their heart to ſtoop,</hi> till a <hi>good word hath come,</hi> and <hi>made it better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is in <hi>the ſpirit of Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Nuntius pacis,</hi> hee that declares, and ſeales up the peace to the ſoule, and is the meſſenger of peace betwixt God and Chriſt, and the ſoule that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and believing in him hath life. Thus it is in him. Now if you aske how the child of God may draw this peace from Chriſt, I anſwer theſe three wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>Meditation</hi> of him; thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>my meditation of him ſhall be ſweet,</hi> the ſoule-feeding up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93551:229"/> the gracious acts of grace, in which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath declared the yernings of his love to poor ſoules, ſhall rather peace a quietment, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of ſpirit in the midſt of all its troubles: when the poore Chriſtian is in the midſt of troubles, to ſit down and think, well, yet my ſinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, yet God and I are at agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this affliction, this croſſe comes not to me as a law demand, not as a piece of vindicative juſtice, but as a fatherly chaſtiſement; this ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter peace to his ſoule, his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt ſhall be <hi>ſweet</hi> to his ſoule: That's one way to gaine it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By a believing application, both of what Chriſt hath ſpake, and what he hath done.</hi> Faith is the hand that the ſoule reacheth out for peace, and by which the ſoule brings in peace to it ſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Beeing juſtified by faith, wee have peace with God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe that believe ſhall bee eſtabliſhed, and the more a ſoule believes, the more it is <hi>eſtabliſhed;</hi> it is from ſome unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes or other, that any ſoule is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93551:229"/> Faith brings in peace, it is not the bare knowing of the promiſe, or the bare knowing of what Chriſt hath done, but the choſen with the promiſe, the choſen with Chriſt in what hee hath done and ſuffered, for the ſoule that brings in peace to the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſoule gaines this place, <hi>by a cloſe walking with Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> a walking in the ſpirit, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 32. 17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe ſhall bee peace;</hi> marke the upright man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juſt man, <hi>the end of that man is peace;</hi> the wicked mans conſcience is continually throwing out <hi>myre and dirt.</hi> There is <hi>no peace to the wicked</hi> (ſaith our God.) Peace indeed is not the wages of a day well ſpent; not a naturall reſult and fruit of a ſtrict wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but peace is the reward of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, the reward not of <hi>debt,</hi> but of <hi>grace.</hi> The words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt hint thus much to us; <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright will I ſhew the ſalvation of God, Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. When a Chriſtian hath orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his converſation aright, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93551:230"/> of God muſt be <hi>ſhewne</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>I have onely one thing remaining, as to the doctrinall part of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: that is, to ſhew you what paines, what order Chriſt hath taken for his Saints peace in him, while in the world they meet with trouble. It may eaſily be gathered, from what I have already ſpoken, in ſhort, take it in theſe three words;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He hath died upon the croſſe, that he might doe it, Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. It coſt him his bloud to work out our peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath given us many precious promiſes,</hi> many things hath he ſpoken, that in him through them wee might have peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He hath ſent his ſpirit, Ioh.</hi> 14. hee promiſed the ſending of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whom he there calls the <hi>comforter,</hi> in relation to the peace, that the ſpirit conveyes, and ſeales to the ſoules of his Saints. Thus much may ſerve brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ſpoken to the doctrinall part, I proceed now to the application of what I have ſaid; I ſhall apply it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>And from what you have heard, that <hi>true peace for the ſoule, in the midſt of this worlds troubles, is only to be found in Chriſt, and onely that which is drawne from Chriſt.</hi> Every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath ground to bring the peace of his ſpirit, the comming of his ſpirit after trouble to the touchſtone, that he may be able to know, whether it be <hi>Chriſts peace</hi> or his owne: I ſhall give you five or ſix notes for that.</p>
